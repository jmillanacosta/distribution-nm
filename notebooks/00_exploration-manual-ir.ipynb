We herein developed a controlled, stepwise strategy to build novel, anisotropic, branched, gold nanoarchitectures (Au-tripods) with predetermined composition and morphology for bioimaging. The resultant Au-tripods with size less than 20 nm showed great promise as contrast agents for in vivo photoacoustic imaging (PAI). We further identified Au-tripods with two possible configurations as high-absorbance nanomaterials from various gold multipods using a numerical simulation analysis. The PAI signals were linearly correlated with their concentrations after subcutaneous injection. The in vivo biodistribution of Au-tripods favorable for molecular imaging was confirmed using small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Intravenous administration of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Cys (RGDfC) peptide conjugated Au-tripods (RGD-Au-tripods) to U87MG tumor-bearing mice showed PAI contrasts in tumors almost 3-fold higher than for the blocking group. PAI results correlated well with the corresponding PET images. Quantitative biodistribution data revealed that 7.9% ID/g of RGD-Au-tripods had accumulated in the U87MG tumor after 24 h post-injection. A pilot mouse toxicology study confirmed that no evidence of significant acute or systemic toxicity was observed in histopathological examination. Our study suggests that Au-tripods can be reliably synthesized through stringently controlled chemical synthesis and could serve as a new generation of platform with high selectivity and sensitivity for multimodality molecular imaging.National Institutes of Health, United Statesdocument-id-old-9ja412001edocument-id-new-14ja-2013-12001eccc-priceIntroductionCurrent biomedical nanotechnology has been aimed at effectively imaging and characterizing abnormal biological processes at the cellular or even molecular level in living subjects.15 Successful progresses in the fundamental molecular imaging research including instrumentations and image construction/registration techniques greatly motivate the innovations of imaging probes. As a relatively new molecular imaging technique, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has recently attracted significant research interests.6 PAI takes advantage of individual strengths of both optical and acoustic imaging while largely overcoming the weaknesses associated with each modality, providing functional and molecular information of abnormalities with deep tissue penetration, high sensitivity, and excellent spatial resolution.7 In addition to several endogenous contrasts (such as melanin and hemoglobin),8 various light-absorbing nanoparticles (including Au-based nanostructures, carbon nanotubes, and nanodroplets) have been developed for PAI contrast enhancement.925 Although there are some nanoparticle-based exogenous agents particularly promising for PAI,20,22 their potential toxicity is still under investigation, and the improvement of their in vivo behavior remains a challenge since most attempts to enhance the contrast effect compromise their pharmacokinetic profile.As one class of strong optical-absorption nanomaterials, colloidal metallic nanostructures (NPs) have recently attracted significant attention from diverse disciplines for many biomedical applications.2628 Many synthetic methods have been developed for the construction of a variety of plasmonic nanostructures with controllable size and uniform shape (for instance, triangles, prisms, rods, cubes, shells, stars, and cages),925,29 largely because the effect of induced-shape anisotropy of these nanostructures results in the splitting of the underlying surface plasmon enhancement (SPR) into several shape-dependent modes, which could be accordingly tuned within the near-infrared window (NIR, 650950 nm).3036 As representative anisotropic nanogeometries, Au-nanorods and -nanocages have shown great promise as PAI contrasts; however, they generally have relatively large particle sizes (50 nm), which could result in unfavorable in vivo behavior and severely limit their application for targeted cancer imaging.7,11,12,21,37 By making a compromise by trading contrast effects for the ability to have preferable in vivo behaviors, strenuous efforts have been made recently to improve their targeting efficiency, and to control pharmacokinetics and biodistributions through variations of their sizes, shapes, and surface properties. Although some metallic nanostructures with complex shapes showed desired tumor targeting efficiency without compromising optical properties, great challenges still remain in the precise control of their geometries and monodispersity.2832Recently, many colloidal hybrid nanostructures with sophisticated architectures have been constructed from multiple functional components either assembled using linkers or fused together by solid-state interfaces.38 In order to build novel hybrid nanostructures with optimal structure and morphology for SPR, we herein developed a synthetic strategy to construct a series of anisotropic gold-based nanomultipods, including dipods, tripods, and tetrapods (Figure 1), with improved yield and excellent quality in a predictable, controlled, and stepwise manner. Among them, the gold tripods (Au tripods) have relatively small sizes with a narrow size distribution and display stringently controlled morphology and, more importantly, have well-defined absorptions in visible and NIR regions. As a proof of concept, we further conjugated v3 integrins targeting the peptide, cyclic c(RGDfC) peptide,39 to PEGylated Au-tripods (RGD-Au-tripods) and used this novel nanoprobe as a PAI contrast agent to image tumor angiogenesis. The tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo profile of PEGylated Au-tripods (modified with different sizes of PEGs and/or RGD) labeled with radionuclide 64Cu were evaluated in a subcutaneous v3-positive U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model using small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Finally, PAI was performed to investigate the targeting and imaging performance of RGD-Au-tripods as photoacoustic contrast agents.Figure 1Construction of gold multipods (including AuPt dumbbell NPs, Au-dipods, Au-tripods and Au-tetrapods). (a) Schematic showing the stepwise syntheses of various gold multipods via a set of known nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes. Various gold multipods are modeled by Lumerical FDTD Solution (Lumerical Solution Inc.). Considering the regioselectivity, several possible regioisomers are shown in the bottom-left panel. (b) TEM images of the resultant gold multipods at different magnifications. HRTEM images of representative gold multipods are shown in the bottom-right panels.ResultsConstruction and Characterization of Au-TripodsBy sequentially applying a set of nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes, we successfully built up four gold-based nanostructures, comprising AuPt dumbbell, dipods, tripods, and tetrapods, with predetermined composition and morphology (Figure 1a). In this structure-guided approach, we chose colloidal platinum (Pt) NPs as core seeds (or starting materials) because they are highly monodisperse and their sizes can be facilely tuned from 3 to 7 nm,40,41 and more importantly, they have definite and rigid cubic shapes (Supporting Information [SI], Figure S4). In order to tune the sizes of Pt nanocrystals, we applied stepwise seed-mediated growth processes to obtain monodisperse Pt nanocubes (SI section C.1.1. and Figure S4). As-synthesized 4.9 nm Pt NPs with truncated cubic shapes could preferably grew into thermodynamically more stable morphologies (cubic 6.5 nm Pt NPs) after an extra seed-mediated growth process. Similarly, 7.5 nm Pt NPs were obtained when 5.8 nm Pt NPs were used as seeds. All Pt nanocubes have a very narrow size and shape distribution (Figure S5 and Table S2). Due to excellent lattice coherence between Pt and Au crystals in the fcc phase, the epitaxial growth of gold preferentially occurs at the vertices of cubic Pt seeds (SI section C.1.2), resulting in the formation of various Au heterostructures (Figure 1). Typically, the epitaxial growth of Au on 4.9 nm Pt seeds produced dumbbell-like AuPt NPs. Use of 5.8 nm Pt NPs as seeds resulted in Au-dipods. There are two geometrical isomers; one is linear and the other is bent, corresponding to para and meta configurations, respectively. Interestingly, we found that, unlike 7.5 nm Pt NPs as seeds resulting in a mixture of tripods and tetrapods, 6.5 nm Pt seeds exclusively led to the formation of tripods with a narrow distribution of size and shape (Figure 1b). The statistical analysis suggested that a majority of resultant NPs were Au-tripods (SI Figure S7S9). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time for constructing novel Au tripods with high yield and improved quality by sequentially applying a set of known nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes.There are two geometrical isomers identified in the resultant tripods; namely one with C3v symmetry is called as tripod-A and the other with C2v symmetry is tripod-T (Figure 1a). The steric accessibility determines the spatial distribution of Au crystals on the Pt nanocubes (SI Scheme S2 and S3). There are two meta positions favorable for the nucleation of incoming Au crystals when an intermediate has a bent shape, thereby resulting in the formation of tripod-A; there are six nucleation positions equal to the incoming Au crystals in the case of a linear intermediate, producing the other type of tripods (tripod-T). The statistical analysis results showed that an amount of tripod-T was finally obtained slightly higher than that of tripod-A (60% vs 40% in the resultant tripods, n = 300, Figure 1a). The sizes and shapes of various Au-multipods and each component within NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM (SI Table S3 and Figure S9). The Au-tripods showed the lowest circularity among the branched NPs, largely due to their anisotropic nanostructures and surface roughness.The representative TEM and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images (Figure 2be) of Au-tripods showed that well-crystallized interfaces were formed between the Pt seeds and grown Au branches. The lattice fringes between Pt seeds and Au branches shown in SI Figure S11 are 0.23 nm and related to (111) planes of either Pt or Au in the fcc phase [2.260 for (111) plane of Pt, 2.355 for (111) plane of Au]. STEM images clearly showed that each Au branch epitaxially grew at one of the vertices of cubic Pt seeds. Two types of tripods, tripod-T and tripod-A, were definitively identified in the STEM images (Figure 2de). The forward and inverse fast Fourier transforms (FFT) were further applied to their HR-TEM images to distinguish Au branches and Pt core. The right panel of Figure 2 shows the HR-TEM images of three typical tripods (the first two belong to the type tripod-T; the third one is tripod-A). The inset in diffractogram patterns shows the splits of the (222) and (331) peaks into two spots: one (blue) for Pt and the other (black) for Au crystal, because of slightly different planar distances of the Pt and Au crystals. Inverse FFT reconstructions of the Pt (bottom) or Au (top) NPs using only their own reflections, [222], [331], [220], and [111], provided the real-spatial distributions of Pt and Au in tripods, respectively. Therefore, the lattice images coupled with the forward and inverse fast Fourier transform further confirmed the spatial configuration of Au branches and Pt core within Au-tripods.Figure 2HRTEM and STEM images of Au-tripods, and their Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform analyses.

Inverse FFT reconstructions of the Pt (bottom) or Au (top) NPs using only the superlattice reflections [222], [220], and [111] are shown in (n).Optical Properties of Au-Tripods and SimulationThe PAI requires contrast agents with relatively large absorption cross section. A conventional UVvisNIR spectrometer can measure the extinction spectra of nanostructures, which comprise two components: scattering and absorption, eventually providing the extinction cross section (e, e = a + s, where a is absorption cross section and s is scattering cross section). As seen in Figure 3a, the Au-tripods have a much stronger extinction peak in the NIR region, compared with the other Au-multipods. There are two plasmon resonances at the 540 and 700 nm peaks in the region of 400 to 1000 nm. The 540 nm feature corresponds to a quadrupole resonance out of the plane of the gold tripods, and the 700 nm feature is attributed to a dipole resonance in the plane of the Au-tripods.20Figure 3Optical properties of Au-tripods, and measurement and simulation of optical absorption cross sections of tripods. (a) UVvis extinction curves of various gold multipods (including AuPt dumbbell NPs, Au-dipods, Au-tripods, and Au-tetrapods) at the same sample weight (based on ICP-MS). (b) UVvis extinction curves of gold nanospheres, cubic platinum NPs, and gold nanorods (54 nm length and 18 nm diameter, more information in the SI, sections C.2 and C.3). (c) The calculated absorption cross section of tripod-T as a function of x (the incident beam is polarized along the z-axis, and the tripod-T is rotated around the x-axis. x is the angle between the e-field and the long axis of tripod-T. (d) The calculated absorption cross section of tripod-A as a function of x (the incident beam is polarized along the z-axis, and the tripod-A is rotated around the x-axis. x is the angle between the e-field and the side of tripod-A. Polarization dependence of the average electric field intensity of tripod-T (e) and tripod-A (f). Electric field intensity contours in xz plane, xy plane, and yz plane at 700 nm were obtained from the FDTD calculations on both tripod-T and tripod-A. The long axis of tripod-T is parallel to the z-axis; one side of tripod-A is parallel to the z-axis. The excitation polarization relative to the z-axis is 0. x and y represent the horizontal and vertical lengths of the calculated area.The a of Au-tripods was calculated using combined UVvisNIR spectrometer and photoacoustic measurements.42 While UVvisNIR spectrometer measures the total extinction coefficient, in photoacoustic imaging, the detected signal is directly proportional to the absorption coefficient (a) of the NPs. Because the SPR peak of the tripods is tuned to 700 nm, methylene blue is suitable as a reference dye to obtain the calibration curve. On the basis of the linear relationship between a and photoacoustic signal amplitude and the known a of methylene blue (SI Figure S15), the photoacoustic signals from Au-tripods with different concentrations were converted into a, and the a of Au-tripods was calculated by dividing the a by the corresponding concentration of the Au-tripods. In the calculation, the a and e of the tripods at 670 nm were 2.02 0.03 1016 and 2.06 0.03 1016 m2, respectively (a/e = 0.98). As a result, on a per-weight basis, the Au-tripods are generally able to generate more contrast (33%) on PA images within the NIR region compared to gold rods (SI Table S4).To gain more insight into the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra and to obtain better structural optimization, we performed numerical analysis on various gold multipods using a commercial finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation package (Lumerical Solution Inc., Canada). The Au-multipods are modeled as a cubic Pt core with Au spheres (see detailed modeling in the SI sections B.3 and C.4). The corresponding geometrical parameters were obtained from the previous results in SI Tables S2 and S3. The contributions of absorption cross sections of two types of Au-tripods (tripod-T and tripod-A) as a function of the rotated angle around the x-axis were obtained using the FDTD simulation and are shown in c and d of Figure 3. The calculated absorption cross section maxima of tripod-T were at 530 and 710 nm, in good agreement with experimental data (a and c of Figure 3), while theoretical absorption maximum peaks of tripod-A occurred at 520 and 900 nm (very broad peak centered at 900 nm). Using the FDTD method, we have further studied the near-field optical properties of all gold multipods, gold rods, and nanospheres (SI section C.4, Figures S16S21). The electric field intensity contours were calculated at the excitation wavelength of 700 nm as the excitation polarization was varied gradually from the longitudinal to transverse directions. Similar to gold rods, the Au-tripods have a strong polarization-dependent cross section. It was clear that under the resonance excitation, the maximum field enhancement regions were observed to rotate away from vertical tripod as the excitation polarization rotated around the y-axis (SI Figure S18). It is worth noting that the electric fields on the surface of Au-tripods (especially Au-tripod-T) are 23 orders of magnitude higher when compared to fields around spherical gold nanoparticles at the same weight in the NIR range. As seen in the Figure 3e,f and SI Figure S18, the edges of tripods and the junctions between two AuAu NPs on the Pt cores are locations of enhanced fields (also called hot spots), due to the occurrence of coupled plasmons.Surface Modification of Au-TripodsIn order to stabilize the Au-tripods in the aqueous solution and provide the capability for subsequent surface modification, we developed a facile, versatile PEGylation strategy which can significantly increase in vivo circulation time of resultant NPs and reduce their reticuloendothelial system (RES) accumulation versus uncoated counterparts. The PEGylation of Au-tripods involved the formation of goldthiolate bonds at the goldsulfur interface and the self-assembly of a monolayer on gold surface (SI Scheme S1).43 The bidentate thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains facilitated subsequent immobilization of various biological molecules via bioconjugation chemistry. The c(RGDfC) was efficiently and site-specifically conjugated on the maleimide-terminated NPs in an oriented and homogeneous fashion. In order to track the RGD-Au-tripods in vivo by PET, the radioactive metal chelator, 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) was further conjugated to the surface of RGD-Au-tripods in a well-defined manner for 64Cu radiolabeling. The hydrodynamic size change and the corresponding change in potentials of modified Au-tripods clearly confirmed the efficient conjugation of the c(RGDfC) peptide to the nanoparticles (SI Figure S25 and Table S5S8). RGD-Au-tripods also showed excellent stability under physiological conditions. There were no significant size changes or aggregation in the presence of the mouse serum after 48 h at 37 C (SI Figure S27). We also validated the targeting ability of RGD-Au-tripods to v3-positive U87MG cells in vitro by determining their cellular uptake using TEM and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis (SI Figures S28 and S29).In order to obtain a better understanding of the in vivo behavior of Au-tripods and study their potential toxicity, we carried out a pilot preclinical animal toxicity study to assess the potential toxicity of tripods to pave the way for their clinical translation. Both hematology and serum biochemistry analyses, and histologic and microscopic examination revealed that no evidence of significant acute toxicity was observed and the tripods are likely highly biocompatible in small living subjects (SI Figures S35S37).Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Au-TripodsThe pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor-targeting ability of Au-tripods were investigated in small living animals. As described in the previous section, the water-soluble Au-tripods were coated with a layer of functional PEG chains. Quantification of grafted PEG density on PEGylated Au-tripods was performed using spectrophotometric analyses of free amines on the PEGylated Au-tripods (SI Table S6). Typically, the density of amine groups on Au-tripod (PEG 3400 coating) was 0.966 0.07 number/nm2; the ratio of amine groups to a single tripod was 757 56. The chelating agent NOTA was attached to the terminal of PEG chains for PET radionuclide 64Cu. Importantly, the 64Cu radiolabels on the tripods remained intact on the tripods even though they were incubated in the mouse serum over 24 h.The U87MG tumor-bearing mice (n = 4) were tail-vein injected with 64CuAu-tripod, followed by small animal PET scans at different time points (1, 2, 4, 24, and 48 h). PET imaging results revealed nonspecific uptake of PEGylated tripods by the liver, spleen, and even kidney (Figure 4a and SI Figures S30S32), but minimum accumulation in the muscle or other major organs. Although most of the tripods were eliminated through hepatic excretion, the kidney retention of radio-labeled tripods over time suggested that the renal excretion could be an additional clearance route for tripods in mice. Since the heart acted as a cardiac blood pool, the signals from the heart were used as indicators to calculate the blood circulation time. The PEGylated tripods showed slow systemic clearance because of a long blood circulation time (t1/2 = 2.29 h), making themselves more available for distribution to target tissues via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.Figure 4Small animal PET images and PET quantification of intravenous injected tripods with different surface functionalization in mice bearing the U87MG human glioblastroma tumor. (ac) Targeting of integrin v3-postitive U87MG tumor in mice by RGD-functionalized tripods.

Data represent mean SD ** P 0.01, *P 0.05 (two-sided Students t-test).Targeting Characteristics of RGD-Au-TripodsIn order to target the integrin v3 for imaging tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, the Au-tripods were conjugated with both p-SCN-Bn-NOTA for 64Cu labeling and c(RGDfC) for tumor targeting. The numbers of NOTA on the RGD-tripod were determined by an isotope dilution assay and typically equaled 54.5 3.3.44 The conjugated RGD was actually determined by measuring the differences in concentration of RGD using HPLC before and after addition of Au-tripods during the coupling reaction. The ratio of RGD to NOTA on Au-tripods was 8.2 0.5. The targeting ability and specificity of RGD-Au-tripods for the v3 integrin were evaluated in the U87MG tumor-bearing mice (n = 4). The representative coronal and transverse PET images of a mouse acquired at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after tail vein injection of 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods, 64CuAu-tripods, or 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods coinjected with a blocking dose of c(RGDfC) are shown in Figure 4. Quantitative analysis showed that tumor uptake of 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods gradually accumulated in the tumor between 1 and 24 h, reaching a plateau at about 24 h post-injection, and then leveled off in the next 24 h. The 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods exhibited a significantly high tumor uptake of 7.9% ID/g after 24 h post-injection, which was more than 3 times higher than that of plain 64CuAu-tripods (2.6% ID/g). Such high tumor accumulation was attributed to the tumor specific binding affinity of RGD functionalization on the tripods and their long blood circulation time. In the control group, the tumor uptake was significantly blocked when a blocking dose of c(RGDfC) was injected into tumor-bearing mice along with 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods. The reduced tumor uptake was observed (3.8% ID/g after 24 h post-injection), which is significantly lower than that of unblocked one (P 0.05). Interestingly, compared to plain tripods, 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods displayed much longer blood circulation time (t1/2 = 10.3 h for 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods vs t1/2 = 6.4 h for 64CuAu-tripods) and less RES uptake. 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods were also found to be excreted by both hepatobiliary and renal routes, as indicated by the deposition of radioactivity in the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract (b and e of Figure 4), which were also confirmed by the tissue histology following in vivo imaging (SI Figure S40).To confirm the photoacoustic detection of tripods in tumor cells, we incubated U87MG cells with RGD-Au-tripods for 2 h under standard conditions. The cells with internalized RGD-Au-tripods after incubation were washed and placed in agarose phantom at increasing cell concentrations from 11.5 103 to 368 103 cells per well (n = 3 per group). Quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signals from the phantom revealed that the minimum detectable number of tumor cells exposed to RGD-Au-tripods could be as low as 11.5 103 (a and b of Figure 5, and Figure S17 of SI). We observed a linear correlation between the number of RGD-Au-tripod-loaded cells and the corresponding photoacoustic signal. The photoacoustic signal from the phantom when excited at 700 nm provided the best sensitivity to detect tumor cells. Even at 900 nm, the signal was still detectable for 50 103 of tumor cells.Figure 5High sensitivity of Au-tripods for photoacoustic molecular imaging. (a) The top view of three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering of photoacoustic images of an agarose phantom containing decreasing number of U87MG cancer cells exposed to RGD-Au-tripod at different wavelengths (670, 700, 725, 750, 800, 850, 900 nm). The inhomogeneous signal inside wells is due to possible aggregation of cells. (b) Quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signal (relative to the background signal) from the phantom (n = 3).

(h) Photoacoustic signals recorded in vivo increased linearly with the tripod concentration (R2 = 0.96, n = 3 mice, data represent mean SD). The background level represents the endogenous signal measured from tissues. (i) Quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signal (relative to the background signal) (mice n = 3).To test the tripods PAI sensitivity in living mice, we subcutaneously injected the right hind side of a mouse with 30 L of RGD-Au-tripods mixed with Matrigel (n = 3) at increasing concentrations of 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 nM. After the incision was solidified in place, the mouse was placed on its left side (left lateral recumbent) and partially embedded in the agarose gel covered with a water bath, and was then scanned under the photoacoustic system. While the ultrasound signals were used to reconstruct the mouse anatomy, including skin and inclusion edges, the photoacoustic signals showed the tripods contrast in the mice (Figure 5ch). Quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signals from each inclusion using a 3D region of interest drawn over the inclusion revealed a linear correlation between the tripod concentration and the corresponding photoacoustic signal. Compared to the tissue background, about 200 pM of RGD-Au-tripods extrapolated from the signal-concentration curve provided the equivalent photoacoustic signal as the tissue background.Similar to PET imaging, the PAI imaging ability of RGD-Au-tripods to v3 integrin-positive tumor was evaluated in the U87MG tumor-bearing mice (n = 3) (see Figure 6). Before the injection, the photoacoustic and ultrasound images of the mice were taken. Photoacoustic images with lateral step size of 0.25 mm were acquired at 700 nm wavelength. Following the photoacoustic scan, an ultrasound image of the entire tumor area was acquired. The U87MG tumor-bearing mice were then injected with 100200 L of RGD-Au-tripods (200 pmol per kg mouse body weight) in PBS through the tail vein. For the receptor-blocking experiment, mice were coinjected with 21 mol of c(RGDfC)/kg of mouse body weight and 100200 L of RGD-Au-tripods (200 pmol per kg mouse body weight) in PBS through the tail vein. After injection, photoacoustic images were acquired at 700 nm at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h post-injection. Quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signal from the tumor was done by drawing three-dimensional (3D) regions-of-interest (ROIs) around tumors on the basis of the ultrasound images. Since there was the background blood signal in each photoacoustic scan, a subtraction image calculated at the 2-h post-injection image minus the preinjection image is shown in SI Figure S39 and was used to subtract out the background hemoglobin signal and examine the differences between groups. Mice injected with RGD-Au-tripods showed significantly higher photoacoustic signal in the tumor compared with the blocking group coinjected with RGD after 2 h post-injection. Quantitative analysis showed that tumor uptake of RGD-Au-tripods gradually accumulated in the tumor between 1 and 4 h, reaching a plateau at about 2 h post-injection, and then leveled off in the next 2 h. The mice injected with RGD-Au-tripods at 2 h post-injection showed more than 3 times higher photoacoustic signal in the tumor than the mice coinjected with RGD and RGD-Au-tripods. The tumor tissue histology combined with silver staining further confirmed the specific targeting ability of RGD-Au-tripods toward U87MG tumors (SI Figure S40).Figure 6Targeting of integrin v3-postitive U87MG tumors in mice by RGD-Au-tripod. (a) The coronal, sagittal, and transverse views of 3D volume rendering of photoacoustic images and ultrasound images of nude mice bearing U87MG tumors were obtained before injection or at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after intravenous injection of RGD-Au-tripod (200 pmol/kg of mouse body weight, or 2 mg/kg of mouse body weight).

The construction of Au-tripods involved a set of nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes, which are controlled by surface diffusion.45,46 As solid-state analogues of multifunctional organic molecules, Pt nanocubes could be used as building blocks to construct sophisticated hybrid architectures.38,41 Although Sun and co-workers provided an important insight in the formation of various branched NPs,41 the stochastic simulation in two dimensions inevitably overlooked certain configurations of constructed nanostructures. The selective growth of a heterogeneous nanocrystal phase onto certain regions of nanocrystal seeds depends on the surface potential and lattice matching.46 We found that regioselectivity of the heterogeneous nucleation on cubic Pt seeds plays an important role on the formation of nanotripods (SI Schemes S1 and S2). Considering the possible nucleation regions and steric effect, 6.5 nm cubic seeds exclusively resulted in the formation of uniform Au-tripods with high yield and improved quality by sequentially applying a set of known nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes.The theoretical calculation coupled with experimental results on such anisotropic tripod nanostructures was used as a guide for the design and fabrication of PAI nanoprobes. We successfully identified tripods with two possible configurations as high absorbance nanomaterials from various gold multipods using a numerical simulation analysis. The enhancement of the electric field on the surface of Au-tripods is due to the occurrence of coupled plasmons at the edges of tripods and the junctions between gold nanocrystals on the Pt cubes. Optimizing the geometrical configurations of gold nanocrystals on the Pt cube could improve the plasmon resonances of Au-tripods. The measured absorption spectrum of Au-tripods was identified by the calculated FDTD spectrum. Due to an obvious increase in the cross section of Au-tripods on a per-weight basis compared to that of the gold rods, Au-tripods could generate more contrast on PA images within the NIR region. Among nanoparticle-based PA contrast agents, Au-tripods exhibit superior optical properties in the NIR region, and more importantly, they have exceptionally small sizes, which are distinctive advantages over traditional gold-based NPs or carbon nanotubes for in vivo molecular imaging.15,24,47We have successfully validated novel Au-tripods as multimodality probes for in vivo molecular imaging (PAI and PET). The in vivo biodistribution of Au-tripods favorable for living subject imaging was confirmed by 64Cu radiolabeling and imaging their localization over time using PET. After intravenous administration, the Au-tripods accumulated in liver and spleen, suggesting that the hepatic excretion is a major route of elimination of Au-tripods. Interestingly, the kidney retention of Au-tripods over time revealed that the renal excretion could be an additional clearance route for Au-tripods. Considering the anisotropic shape of Au-tripods [the thickness of tripods is close to the renal clearance threshold (less than 7 nm)], it is possible for Au-tripods to be cleared to some extent through the renal system.48,49 The PAI signals were linearly correlated with their concentrations after subcutaneous injection. Intravenous administration of RGD-Au-tripods to U87MG tumor-bearing mice showed remarkably higher contrast in tumors than competitive injection controls even at subnanomolar concentrations. PAI results correlated well with the corresponding PET images. Quantitative biodistribution data revealed that 7.9% ID/g of RGD-Au-tripods accumulated in the U87MG tumor after 24 h post-injection, but an obvious decrease in RES uptake (low liver and spleen accumulation, Figure 4) of RGD-Au-tripods was observed during the imaging. It is clear that their tumor uptake was higher than most of traditional gold-based NPs for in vivo molecular imaging,24,47 probably due to their unique anisotropic shape and relatively small size. A pilot mouse toxicology study confirmed that no evidence of significant acute and systemic toxicity was observed in histopathological examination.ConclusionBy sequentially applying a set of nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes, we herein developed a control and stepwise strategy to build novel anisotropic Au-tripods with predesigned shape, high yield, and excellent quality. These Au-tripods exhibit superior optical and physical properties compared to their counterparts with regular architectures. We showed the ability to tune their shape-dependent plasmon resonances to the NIR window without compromising their pharmacokinetic profile. Our strategy opens up novel ways to enable the creation of sophisticated nanostructures with predetermined optical and physical properties for specific biomedical applications. Moreover, our study suggests that highly selective and sensitive detection of cancer cells in a living subject is possible using molecular specific Au-tripods as PAI contrast agents. The functionalized RGD-tripods showed significantly enhanced photoacoustic contrast effect in both phantom and small animal imaging experiments. Functional and molecular information of the tumor with high spatial resolution was further obtained by PAI, which correlated well with the corresponding PET quantification. Due to their excellent biocompatibility and stability in a biological environment, ease of functionalization, passive and activated targeting capabilities and potential hepatic and renal clearance, the Au-tripods represent a new generation of a nanoplatform for biomedical research and personalized therapy.Methods and MaterialsMaterialsThe integrin v3 targeting peptide cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Cys) (cRGDfC) was purchased from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). The p-SCN-Bn-NOTA was purchased from Macrocyclics, Inc. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate (HAuCl4) and platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) was ordered from Strem Chemicals, Inc. N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, hydrochloride (EDC) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other solvents and chemicals were used as received. All buffers and media were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. Deionized water was obtained from a Millipore Milli-DI Water Purification system. The dialysis membrane tubing (MWCO: 12,00014,000, and 100,000) were purchased from Spectrum laboratories.Size Tuning of Cubic Pt NPsThe size of various cubic Pt NPs was successfully tuned by adjustment of the reaction conditions in a precise manner. Monodisperse Pt seeds were synthesized by thermal decomposition of platinum precursor [Pt(acetylacetonate)2, Pt(acac)2], in 1-octadecene solution containing a trace amount of iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO)5], which facilitates a fast nucleation and improves the homogeneous growth of platinum crystals.40 The shape and size of Pt NPs are dependent on the reaction temperature at which a trace amount of Fe(CO)5 was injected. Multiple stepwise seed-mediated growth processes were applied to obtain monodisperse Pt nanocubes. The detailed synthesis procedure is described in the SI Methods.Synthesis and Surface Modification of Au-TripodsThe gold precursor (hydrogen tetrachloroaurate, HAuCl4, 100 mg, 0.29 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of 1-octadecene (ODE) containing 2 mL of oleylamine under nitrogen protection. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, the solution was heated up to 80 C. Twenty milligrams of 6.5 nm freshly synthesized Pt NPs (dispersed in 1 mL of hexane) was quickly injected into the above solution. The resultant mixture was then heated up to 110 C and kept at this temperature for one hour before it was cooled down to room temperature. The solution finally turned to gray-purplish color, indicating the formation of gold branched nanostructures. The particles were precipitated out by adding 30 mL of isopropanol and collected by a centrifuge (3000 rcf, 5 min). The resultant particles were redispersed in 5 mL of hexane and then precipitated out by adding ethanol. This purification step was repeated twice to remove the extra surfactant and ODE. The final product (Au-tripods) was dispersed in 10 mL of hexane in the presence of 0.01 mL of oleylamine for further use.Surface PEGylation of Au-tripods is described in detail in the SI sections A.4, B.2, C.5, and C.6. Briefly, the Au-tripods (10 mg) were suspended in 3 mL of a chloroform solution of bidentate thiol-termined PEG chains (O-(3-aminopropyl)polyethylene glycol lipoate amide, LP-PEG-3400-NH2, 0.02 mmol, SI section A.3). After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, PEGylated Au-tripods were precipitated by adding 20 mL of hexane, collected by a brief centrifugation, and dried under the nitrogen gas flow. PEGylated Au-tripods were then dispersed in water, and the unbound PEG and any other excess reagents were removed by dialysis against water or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM, pH 7.4) by dialysis tubing (Spectrum Spectra/Por dialysis membrane tubing, MWCO = 12 KDa). Any impurity or precipitate was removed by a 0.22 m syringe filter. The final gold or platinum concentration of PEGylated Au-tripods was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. Those NPs were further characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UVvis absorption spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (SI sections B.2, B.3, B.5, and sections C.4, C.6).Conjugation of Au-tripods with cRGD (RGD-Au-tripods) is described in detail in the SI Sections A.5, C.6, and C.7. Typically, The cross-linker solution, the water-soluble Au-tripods (100 nM, 0.5 mL, 5 1011 mol, see the determination of concentrations of tripods and rods in SI section C.3) in 10 mM PBS (pH = 7.2) were incubated with the cross-linker solution (sulfo-SMCC [0.5 mg, 1.5 mol], was freshly prepared in 15 L of DMSO) for 2 h at room temperature. After removal of excessive sulfo-SMCC and byproducts using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), the resultant thiol-active Au-tripods were concentrated to the final volume of 0.5 mL with a centrifugal-filter (Amicon centrifugal filter device, MWCO = 30 kDa) and were incubated with the cRGDfC stock solution (50 L of 5 mM in the degassed water, 0.25 mol, the final RGD concentration in the mixture was 0.5 mM) with stirring. The conjugation reaction proceeded for 24 h at 4 C. After the uncoupled RGD and byproducts were removed through PD-10 column, the resultant product, RGD-Au-tripods, was concentrated by a centrifugal-filter (Amicon centrifugal filter device, MWCO = 30 KDa) and stored at 4 C for one month without losing targeting activity. The final RGD-Au-tripods was reconstituted in PBS and filtered through a 0.22 m filter for cell and animal experiments. The gold and platinum concentrations of RGD-Au-tripods were measured by ICP-MS analysis.The process to conjugate the tripods with both RGD and NOTA was similar to the conjugation of tripods and RGD, except that sulfo-SMCC solution was mixed with NOTA aqueous solution in the first step before being added into the tripod solution. Briefly, The sulfo-SMCC (0.5 mg, 1.5 mol) was dissolved in 15 L of DMSO and mixed with 4.5 L of p-SCN-Bn-NOTA solution in the water (33 mM, 0.15 mol). The ratio of SMCC to NOTA was optimized according to the specific activity of radioactive tracer-labeled NPs (SI section C.7).Small Animal PET ImagingPET imaging was carried out on a microPET R4 rodent model scanner (manufactured by CTI Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN) as previously reported.5052 PET scans were performed at 1, 2, 4, 24, and 48 h post-injection (p.i.). U87MG tumor-bearing mice were divided into several injection groups (4 mice per each group) to evaluate differences in specific targeting and biodistribution of Au-tripods and RGD modified tripods (SI section A.5 and C.7). For the tripod groups, each mice was injected with 3.7 MBq of 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripod (200 pmol/kg of mouse body weight, or 2 mg/kg of mouse body weight, normally 5 pmol per each mouse) in 100200 L PBS via the tail vein. For the receptor-blocking experiment, U87MG tumor-bearing mice were coinjected with 12 mg of c(RGDfC)/kg of mouse body weight and 100200 L of 64Cu-RGD-Au tripod (200 pmol per kg mouse body weight) in PBS via the tail vein. Prior to imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction and 2% for maintenance in house oxygen at 2 L/min). Mice (4 mice per group) were placed in the prone position and near the center of the field of view (FOV) of the scanner. The 5-min static scans were obtained at the predetermined time points after post-injection. All the PET images were then reconstructed by a two-dimensional ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with a spatial resolution of 1.661.85 mm.53 PET quantifications were analyzed using both AsiPro and Amide image processing software. PET quantification details are included in the SI.Au-Tripod-RGD Tumor Targeting in Living MiceThe custom-built photoacoustic instrument was described previously and is shown in SI Figure S2.5456 The photoacoustic characterizations of Au-tripods were further determined by NEXUS 128 (Endra, MI). Two groups of female nude mice (n = 3 in each group, 68 weeks old) were inoculated subcutaneously at their right hind side with 5 106 U87MG cells in 50 L of PBS. The tumors were allowed to grow to a volume of 150200 mm3. The mouse was placed on its left side (left lateral recumbent) and partially embedded in the agarose gel covered with a water bath (SI Figure S2), and was then scanned under the photoacoustic system. Before the injection, the photoacoustic and ultrasound images of the mice were taken. A photoacoustic image with lateral step size of 0.25 mm was acquired using the 5 MHz transducer at 670, 700, and 725 nm wavelength. Following the photoacoustic scan, an ultrasound image was acquired using the 25 MHz transducer. The U87MG tumor-bearing mouse was then injected with 100200 L of RGD-Au-tripods (200 pmol per kg mouse body weight) in PBS through the tail vein using a butterfly catheter to avoid any position change during the injection (50 L of dead volume) (SI Figure S2B). For the receptor-blocking experiment, mice were coinjected with 21 mol of c(RGDfC)/kg of mouse body weight and 100200 L of RGD-Au-tripods (200 pmol per kg mouse body weight) in PBS through the tail vein. After injection, photoacoustic images (20 mm 20 mm) were acquired at 670, 700, and 725 nm with step size of 0.25 mm and at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h post-injection. Following the photoacoustic scan, the ultrasound images were acquired to confirm the scan area. The photoacoustic and ultrasound images were analyzed, coregistered, and displayed using AMIDE software. Quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signal from the tumor was done by drawing three-dimensional ROIs around the tumor on the basis of the ultrasound images. After 4 h post-injection, the mice were sacrificed, and tumors and tissues of interest were collected for TEM (SI section B.1), elemental analysis (SI section B.5), and histology study (SI section B.6).Supporting Information AvailableDetailed methodology, characterization, simulation, additional figures, and discussion.

Here we extend the capability of this strategy to synthesize radioactive 198Au nanostructures with a similar size but different shapes and then compare their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution using a murine EMT6 breast cancer model. Specifically, we investigated Au nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages. After PEGylation, an aqueous suspension of the radioactive Au nanostructures was injected into a tumor-bearing mouse intravenously, and their biodistribution was measured from the radiation while their tumor uptake was directly imaged using the Cerenkov radiation. Significantly higher tumor uptake was observed for the Au nanospheres and nanodisks relative to the Au nanorods and nanocages at 24 h postinjection. Furthermore, autoradiographic imaging was performed on thin slices of the tumor after excision to resolve the intratumoral distributions of the nanostructures. While both the Au nanospheres and nanodisks were only observed on the surfaces of the tumors, the Au nanorods and nanocages were distributed throughout the tumors.Cerenkov imagingradioactive gold nanostructuresbiodistributiontumor uptakeintratumoral distributionshape dependenceNational Institutes of Health, United Statesdocument-id-old-9nn406258mdocument-id-new-14nn-2013-06258mccc-priceNanostructures are of great importance for a wide variety of applications in cancer theranostics including imaging, drug delivery, and therapy.1 Among various types of nanostructures, those based on Au have received increasing attention in recent years owing to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties. Arising from the collective oscillation of conduction electrons confined to a nanoscale structure, the LSPR causes strong absorption and scattering of light at tunable wavelengths for optical imaging and photothermal destruction of tumors.24 By forming anisotropic shapes such as nanorods, nanodisks, and nanocages, the LSPR can be tuned into the transparent window (700900 nm) of soft tissues in the near-infrared (NIR) region to meet the requirements for in vivo application.5 In addition, Au nanostructures can be functionalized with radioactive species for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging,6 Cerenkov imaging,79 and/or radiotherapy10 through radiolabeling with +-emitting 64Cu nuclides6 or incorporation of -emitting 198Au isotopes.11 Importantly, these radioactive imaging modalities, whether based on -rays or visible light, can be used not only for the in vivo biodistribution analysis of Au nanostructures but also for monitoring their uptake by the targeted disease site.To fully realize their potential in cancer theranostics, the nanostructures must be able to enter the tumor and be evenly distributed throughout the tumor, which is composed of heterogeneous microenvironments containing both vascular and avascular volumes.12 It has been established that nanostructures can enter a tumor by leaking out through the gaps between endothelial cells of the chaotic and hyperpermeable vasculature of a tumor through a mechanism known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.1316 The efficacy of this process depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanostructures, including both size and shape. It has been shown that spherical particles of 50100 nm in diameter tend to present an optimal range of size for maximizing tumor accumulation due to the EPR effect and minimizing the subsequent clearance.1719 Compared to nanospheres, nanostructures with other shapes (e.g., nanorods) can have distinct EPR effects due to alterations to their in vivo hydrodynamic behaviors such as circulation, transport in blood flow, and extravasation into the tumor.2025 However, due to the difficulty in generating nanostructures with the same uniform size but different shapes from the same material, the effect of shape on the EPR effect and thus tumor uptake still needs further assessment. In addition, the influence of size or shape of nanostructures on their in vivo intratumoral distribution is yet to be explored despite its paramount importance in cancer diagnosis and therapy. While it has been observed that rod-shaped nanostructures like carbon nanotubes tended to penetrate into the core of a tumor more effectively compared to their spherical counterparts like quantum dots,26,27 there is essentially no study on the intratumoral distribution of nanostructures with similar sizes but different shapes, particularly those composed of Au with interesting LSPR properties.Due to the great potential of Au nanostructures for oncological imaging and therapy, it is of great importance to systematically evaluate the effects of their shapes on biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution. In this work, we accomplished these goals in a murine EMT6 breast cancer model by incorporating radioactive 198Au ( = 0.96 MeV, t1/2 = 2.7 days) into Au nanostructures with a similar size but four different shapes, including nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages. The radioactive 198Au was directly incorporated into their crystal lattices during the syntheses with precisely controlled specific radioactivity. The characteristic emission from 198Au was directly employed for a quantitative analysis of the biodistribution in a tumor-bearing mouse, whereas the Cerenkov luminescence derived from the emission was used for monitoring tumor uptake in vivo and autoradiography imaging of intratumoral distribution ex vivo. We also performed photoacoustic (PA) imaging, PET imaging, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) histological staining to characterize tumor vascularity, hypoxia, metabolism, and spatial heterogeneity, respectively. Combined together, it can be concluded that incorporation of 198Au into Au nanostructures offers a new platform to stably label nanostructures for quantitative measurements of biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution. The data collected from such multimodal imaging demonstrated that the shape of Au nanostructures indeed played a critical role in determining their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution in a murine EMT6 breast cancer model, which can be further extended to other preclinical cancer models.Results and DiscussionSynthesis and Characterization of 198Au-Incorporated Au NanostructuresIn this study, we employed the strategy of directly incorporating the radionuclide 198Au into the crystal lattice of nanostructures to compare the tumor passive targeting efficiency and intratumoral distribution of Au nanostructures with four different shapes. As we recently demonstrated with Au nanocages,11 the radiation from 198Au could be used for quantitative analyses of biodistribution and tumor targeting efficacy, whereas the visible light generated from emission could be employed for in vivo Cerenkov imaging. Here we further extended this approach to other types of Au nanostructures including nanospheres, nanodisks, and nanorods and then used these nanostructures as probes to understand the impacts of shape on their biodistribution, tumor targeting capability, and intratumoral distribution. Since the radionuclide is incorporated into the crystal lattice of a nanostructure, rather than attached to the surface through a molecular linker, we could accurately analyze the nanostructures in vivo without worrying about potential issues associated with the linker, including in vivo instability and changes to surface characteristics that will affect the biodistribution of nanostructures.6The Au nanostructures were synthesized with a similar size (the largest dimension for those with a nonspherical shape) around 50 nm, which is known to display a significant EPR effect for tumor targeting (Supporting Information Table S1).17 Four distinct shapes, including spherical,28 disk-like,29 rod-shaped,30 and cubic,6,31 were evaluated. Figure 1 shows TEM images of these nanostructures in the nonradioactive form. Figure S1 shows the LSPR spectra taken from their aqueous suspensions. The nanospheres had an LSPR peak at 532 nm, while the other three types of nanostructures all showed LSPR peaks in the NIR region due to their anisotropy in structure, rendering them potential in vivo theranostic agents. Specifically, the LSPR peaks of the nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages were located at 769, 817, and 778 nm, respectively. To use the radioactive property for biodistribution analysis, luminescence imaging, and tumor autoradiographic imaging, 198Au was directly incorporated into the crystal lattice of the Au nanostructure simply by mixing radioactive H198AuCl4 with nonradioactive HAuCl4 prior to their use as the reagents for chemical reduction or galvanic replacement. For each sample of Au nanostructures, the specific radioactivity could be tightly controlled by varying the ratio of H198AuCl4 to HAuCl4 in the mixture while keeping their total amount and therefore the LSPR properties of the resultant nanostructures unchanged.Figure 1TEM images of the four different types of Au nanostructures in the nonradioactive version: (a) nanospheres, (b) nanodisks, (c) nanorods, and (d) cubic nanocages. The scale bar applies to all images.Biodistribution of PEGylated, 198Au-Incorporated Au NanostructuresOnce the 198Au-incorporated Au nanostructures with four distinct shapes had been prepared and surface-functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW 5000), they were injected intravenously via the tail vein into mice bearing EMT6 tumors for a quantitative analysis of biodistribution by tracing the radiation from 198Au. Since the 198Au was incorporated into the lattice of each nanostructure, the 198Au radiolabel showed good stability in mouse serum up to a week as we have demonstrated in a previous study.11 By tracking the radiation emitted by 198Au, we could accurately resolve the spatial distribution of the 198Au-incorporated nanostructures. Similar to the biodistribution profiles previously reported for Au nanostructures,3,6,32,33 all the samples of Au nanostructures showed high hepatic and splenic accumulation (Figures 2 and S2). However, for the Au nanostructures with different shapes, they displayed significant differences for the in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles. Specifically, the PEGylated Au nanospheres circulated in the bloodstream significantly longer than the other three types of nanostructures, with 24.8% injected dose per gram of tissue or blood (% ID/g) circulating at 6 h and 10.4% ID/g remaining in the blood at 24 h postinjection. The nanodisks showed moderate blood circulation, with 16.5% ID/g remaining in the blood at 1 h postinjection, 9.7% ID/g remaining after 6 h, and 0.5% ID/g after 24 h. The nanorods had the worst blood circulation compared with both nanospheres and nanodisks: 11.2% ID/g remained in the blood after 1 h, which further decreased to 0.9% ID/g at 6 h postinjection. The poor performance of Au nanorods can likely be attributed to the low coverage density of PEG chains on the surface due to slow replacement of the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) bilayer by PEG. Compared with the nanorods, the nanocages showed much better blood circulation, which hardly changed during the first 6 h (15.3 and 14.2% ID/g at 1 and 6 h, respectively). Although all types of Au nanostructures showed significant accumulation (20.7 to 43.9% ID/g, depending on the shape) in the liver at 1 h postinjection, the nanospheres showed the least clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), in particular, Kupffer cells in the liver. At 24 h, 34.9% ID/g of nanospheres was located in the liver compared to 55.0, 52.1, and 63.4% ID/g for the nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages, respectively. Furthermore, a smaller portion of the nanospheres accumulated in the spleen relative to other samples, with 5.0% ID/g present at 24 h postinjection, compared to 40% ID/g for nanostructures with the other three shapes within the same time frame. Additional studies were also performed at 24 h postinjection to determine the clearance of these nanostructures by analyzing the Au contents in urine and feces through the use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We did not observe any significant clearance for the four types of Au nanostructures used in the present work.Figure 2Biodistribution of the different types of 198Au-incorporated Au nanostructures at (a) 1 h, (b) 6 h, and (c) 24 h postinjection, together with the tumor uptake data (insets). See Figure S2 for the biodistribution data in terms of % ID/organ.Due to their high blood retention and low clearance by the liver and spleen, the PEGylated Au nanospheres showed better accumulation in tumors than the nanostructures with other shapes, increasing from 2.1% ID/g at 1 h to 11.5% ID/g at 6 h and up to 23.2% ID/g at 24 h. The accumulation of nanodisks in tumors was observed to surge up to 6 h, increasing from 1.5% ID/g at 1 h to 4.4% ID/g at 6 h. Interestingly, the nanodisks remained in the lung more severely than any other shape, with 4.9% ID/g remaining at 24 h postinjection, suggesting other potential applications for pulmonary imaging or therapy. Due to the low blood circulation, the nanorods did not efficiently accumulate in the tumors, with less than 2.0% ID/g accumulated even at 24 h postinjection. The nanocages accumulated in tumors throughout the 24 h period, increasing from 1.2% ID/g at 1 h to 4.7% ID/g at 6 h and finally 7.5% ID/g at 24 h postinjection.In Vivo Luminescence ImagingIn addition to quantitative analysis of biodistribution by following the emission, in vivo luminescence imaging was also performed on the mice bearing EMT6 tumors by monitoring the Cerenkov radiation with a conventional optical in vivo imaging system (IVIS).11 Significantly, luminescence in the visible region could be detected with a low background from all the Au nanostructures in vivo, which could be used to resolve their locations through co-registration with the anatomical X-ray images. As illustrated in Figure 3, all the 198Au-incorporated nanostructures showed accumulation in the tumors in the optical images captured at 24 h postinjection. The luminescence intensities from tumors in mice injected with the nanospheres, nanodisks, and nanocages increased throughout the 24 h period. The changes in luminescence intensity over time generally matched the kinetic data obtained for all the four samples (Figure S3). These data are in agreement with the time-dependent biodistribution shown in Figure 2. In addition, luminescence was observed in areas corresponding to liver and spleen after the injection of all the Au nanostructures. Much stronger luminescence was recorded from the tumor region for both the nanospheres (Figure 3a, 4.7 104 counts) and nanodisks (Figure 3b, 3.9 104 counts) relative to the nanorods (Figure 3c, 2.6 104 counts) and nanocages (Figure 3d, 2.8 104 counts) at 24 h postinjection, which is different from the order observed for biodistribution. Since the Cerenkov luminescence produced from radioactive decay is expected to experience attenuation due to the absorption and scattering by tissues before it reaches the detector, other factors such as intratumoral distribution can have an impact on its intensity. After the animal organs had been harvested, the luminescence signals were mainly detected from liver, spleen, and tumor for all the four types of nanostructures with intensities consistent with the data obtained in biodistribution studies (Figure S4). Previously, we have examined the in vivo toxicity of Au nanostructures with a dose of 400 g/mouse via histological analysis and did not observe any toxic effect.34 In this study, with the administration of Au nanostructures at a less amount, we did not observe any adverse effect either.Figure 3Co-registered in vivo luminescence and X-ray images of the tumor-bearing mice at 1 h (left panel) and 24 h (right panel) postinjection of the different types of 198Au-incorporated nanostructures: (a) nanospheres, (b) nanodisks, (c) nanorods, and (d) cubic nanocages.Intratumoral Distribution of NanostructuresIn order to better understand the shape dependence of intratumoral distribution for the Au nanostructures, the tumors were excised from the mice at 24 h postinjection, microtomed into multiple slices of about 50 m thick. The cross sections of these slices were then subjected to autoradiography imaging. Noticeable differences were observed for the Au nanostructures with different shapes. Interestingly, signals associated with the 198Au-incorporated nanostructures were only detected in the periphery of the tumors for both nanospheres (Figure 4a) and nanodisks (Figure 4b), whereas signals were detected throughout the tumor when the mice were injected with either nanorods (Figure 4c) or nanocages (Figure 4d). In addition, for the case of nanorods or nanocages, the strongest signal was located at the core of the tumor. This result offers one explanation for the observation that tumors in the mice injected with the nanospheres or nanodisks showed stronger luminescence than the tumors in mice injected with the nanorods or nanocages. We believe that the Cerenkov radiation was attenuated more significantly when originating from the core rather than the surface of a tumor because the photons had to travel through a thicker layer of tissue before it was detected. Of course, other factors such as the level of accumulation also played a role, as supported by the nanospheres, which exhibited both the greatest % ID/g accumulation in tumor and the strongest luminescence intensity in the region of interest (ROI). Moreover, it should be pointed out that the actual size of nanoparticles can also affect the intratumoral distribution profile.35 A further study comparing the intratumoral distributions of nanoparticles with different sizes will lead to the identification of nanostructure with optimal size and shapes for cancer imaging and therapy.Figure 4Autoradiographic images of tumor slices at 24 h postinjection of the different types of 198Au-incorporated Au nanostructures: (a) nanospheres, (b) nanodisks, (c) nanorods, and (d) cubic nanocages.The accumulation of nanostructures in tumors can be explained by the EPR effect, a well-established phenomenon that plays an important role in both passive and active targeting. This phenomenon, however, only occurs in vascularized tumors, and the efficacy is closely related to the angiogenesis process and tumor vasculature.1416,36,37 To validate the involvement of the EPR effect in our system, we used PA imaging to characterize the vasculature in the EMT6 tumor. Figure 5a shows a coronal (top view) maximum amplitude projection (MAP) image, clearly revealing the vasculatures inside the tumor (indicated by the dashed circle) and surrounding tissues. The sagittal (side view) MAP image in Figure 5b shows a well-resolved vasculature to a depth of approximately 2.1 mm. The tumor blood volume quantified by PA imaging was 2.3 0.2 times greater than other tissues, consistent with the fast-growing nature of the EMT6 tumor model.6 The vasculature present in the EMT6 tumor provides an avenue for the nanostructures to transport into the tumor. The vascularity was further characterized by histological staining (Figure S5) and PET imaging with 64Cu(II) diacetylbis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM),38 which was supposed to be localized in the hypoxic regions away from the vasculature. As shown in Figures 6 and S6, the uptake of 64Cu-ATSM was relatively low. Specifically, the tumor was characterized by a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 0.4 0.1, tumor-to-muscle ratio of 2.1 0.4, and accumulation of 2.0 0.6% ID/g for 64Cu-ATSM. The accumulation was much lower than the data (4.2 1.0% ID/g) previously reported for the hypoxic EMT6 tumor at a later stage of development,39 confirming the well-oxygenated tumor environment and active angiogenesis process during the study period, as shown in Figure 5b.Figure 5Photoacoustic microscopy images of the EMT6 tumor in a mouse: (a) coronal MAP image viewed from the top and (b) sagittal MAP image viewed from the side.Figure 6(Left) Co-registered 18F-FDG PET/CT images of a BALB/c mouse bearing a EMT6 tumor. (Right) Quantitative comparisons of standardized uptake values, % ID/g, and tumor/muscle ratios for the 18F-FDG and 64Cu-ATSM tracers.In general, most solid tumors have a heterogeneous pattern of intratumoral blood vessels. As shown in Figure S5, the vasculature in the EMT6 tumor was largely heterogeneously distributed, with vessel density varying greatly throughout the tumor. We also observed a heterogeneous microenvironment consisting of blood vessels, individual red blood cells associated with the leaky vessels, and necrotic areas containing inflammatory cells. Interestingly, high metabolism in the tumor was confirmed by PET imaging with 18F-flourinated deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) (Figure 6).40 Significant tumor uptake of 18F-FDG was observed, with SUV of 1.5 0.3, accumulation of 8.0 1.2% ID/g, and tumor-to-muscle ratio of 5.8 1.4. The 18F-FDG uptake was relatively homogeneous throughout the tumor volume, suggesting a general glycolytic phenotype throughout both aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments, a common characteristic of many types of cancers.The data from PA imaging, histology staining, and PET imaging all showed the hallmarks expected for the tumor model, including the presence of intratumoral vasculature, heterogeneous microenvironments, and high metabolism of glucose. We can take advantage of these features to deliver nanostructures into tumors for diagnosis and photothermal therapy. While the vasculature serves as an entryway for nanostructures to enter the tumor, it is the convective flow that determines intratumoral distribution of nanostructures. The nanostructures can accumulate in a tumor by leaking out through the pores in the vascular walls due to the EPR effect. Once outside the vasculature, however, the transport of nanostructures is controlled by diffusion through the hypoxic microenvironments. To be distributed throughout the EMT6 tumor, the nanostructures must be able to flow through the tumor microvasculature, leak out through pores in the vascular walls, and then diffuse through distinct microenvironments containing necrotic, avascular volumes. It has been observed that nanostructures with smaller sizes were able to diffuse deeper into tumors compared to their larger counterparts,41 and that the transport of nanorods through porous media was mainly determined by the smaller dimension.27 In this study, all the four colloidal samples of Au nanostructures showed good stability when incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate buffer saline at 37 C for up to 24 h (Figure S7), excluding the possible effect of particle aggregation on the EPR effect. Since the Au nanorods had two of their dimensions less than 15 nm, they should have a better chance to leak out through the small pores in the microvasculature of a tumor and penetrate into the tumor volume, as evidenced by the autoradiography image in Figure 4c. Other factors such as the tumbling motion of a nanorod under flow and the diffusion motion outside the vasculature could also affect its ability to penetrate through the tumor.42The shape of a particle can affect its properties such as the friction coefficient,42 resistance, and buoyancy.43 For vasculature-based passive targeting, the convective flow inside the vessels, which also determines the intratumoral distribution of nanoparticles, is largely determined by the pressure difference between the vasculature and the interstitial space of a tumor.41 Because the nanocage has a hollow core and six flat faces, these factors may significantly increase its convective and diffusive properties in the tumor tissue compared to the spherical counterparts. Additionally, the hollow core gives the nanocage a lower density, which can affect their resistance and increase buoyancy during diffusive transport in vivo. As revealed by the autoradiography image in Figure 4d, these effects allow the nanocage to flow through tumor microvasculature, leak out through pores, and diffuse through interstitial tumor space to reach microenvironments inside the entire tumor.ConclusionIn summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis of radioactive Au nanostructures with a similar size but four different shapes by directly incorporating 198Au into their crystal lattices. The radiolabeling integrity and stability associated with these nanostructures have enabled us to quantitatively analyze their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution using a murine EMT6 breast cancer model. Specifically, the biodistribution could be quantified by measuring the radiation from 198Au, whereas both tumor uptake and intratumoral distribution could be measured by detecting the emission for Cerenkov radiation and autoradiography. Of the four shapes, the 198Au-incorporated nanospheres showed the best blood circulation, the lowest clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, and the highest overall tumor uptake relative to nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages. Interestingly, nanorods and nanocages could reach the cores of the tumors, whereas nanospheres and nanodisks were only observed on the surfaces of the tumors, suggesting the unique positions of Au nanorods and nanocages for photothermal cancer treatment.34 Future studies need to focus on further improving the blood circulation half-life and pharmacokinetics of these Au nanostructures to reduce uptake by liver and spleen and minimize radiation burden, test these 198Au nanostructures in other tumor models, and add molecular targeting ligands to their surfaces to increase their tumor uptake for better use of the therapeutic capability provided by the emission and photothermal conversion.Materials and MethodsChemicals and ReagentsPoly(ethylene glycol)monomethyl ether thiol (Mw 5000 Da) was purchased from Laysan Bio (Arab, AL). All other chemicals or reagents, including sodium borohydride (NaBH4), CTAB, chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), ascorbic acid, sodium citrate, silver nitrate (AgNO3), concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), and nitric acid (HNO3) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All chemicals were used as received.Preparation of Radioactive H198AuCl4Proper radiation safety training and personal protection equipment are required because 198Au is a strong emitter (Emax = 0.96 MeV, 99% abundance). The 198Au (specific activity = 3.7 GBq/mg) was produced at the University of Missouri using the MURR irradiation facility. Briefly, 530 mg of Au foil was irradiated at a flux of 8 1013 n/cm2/s. After irradiation, the radioactive foil was dissolved with 0.4 mL of freshly prepared aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 = 3/1, v/v) under heating at 90 C for 5 min. The solution was then dried by heating at 100 C, reconstituted in 0.4 mL of 0.05 M HCl twice, and finally reconstituted in 0.1 M HCl for shipping. Upon receiving, the sample was dried by heating to 130 C and reconstituted in ultrapure water. This procedure was repeated three times to remove the acids and nitrogen oxide byproducts. To incorporate 198Au into the lattices of the Au nanostructures, the radioactive H198AuCl4 was mixed with nonradioactive HAuCl4 prior to their use in a synthesis.Preparation of 198Au-Incorporated Au NanodisksThe radioactive nanodisks were prepared by etching away the corners of Au triangular nanodisks, which were synthesized by following a previously reported method with the use of 107 MBq of H198AuCl4.29 After the 198Au-incorporated triangular nanodisks were purified by centrifugation, aqueous HAuCl4 solution (10 mM) in CTAB (100 nM) was added slowly (13 L for each time) into 1 mL of the triangular nanodisks to generate round nanodisks. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation once the LSPR peak had reached 770 nm.Preparation of 198Au-Incorporated Au NanocagesThe radioactive nanocages were prepared via the galvanic replacement reaction between Ag nanocubes and a mixture of H198AuCl4 and HAuCl4.31 An aqueous suspension of Ag nanocubes (48 nm in edge length) were prepared, and then titrated with an aqueous solution containing H198AuCl4 (81 MBq) and HAuCl4 (0.75 mM) dropwise (30 mL/h). The reaction was stopped by centrifugation when the LSPR peak had reached 780 nm.Preparation of 198Au-Incorporated Au NanospheresThe radioactive nanospheres were prepared via seed-mediated growth by using ascorbic acid as a reducing agent and sodium citrate as a colloidal stabilizer.28 The synthesis involved the use of 59 MBq of H198AuCl4 and 30 nm Au nanospheres as the seeds. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation once the LSPR peak had reached 530 nm.Preparation of 198Au-Incorporated Au NanorodsThe radioactive nanorods were prepared using a seed-mediated method that involved the addition of a suspension of Au spherical seeds to a growth solution in the presence of CTAB as a capping agent.30 First, 250 L of an aqueous HAuCl4 solution (10 mM) was added to 7.5 mL of a 0.1 M CTAB solution in a 20 mL glass vial. Then, 0.6 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (10 mM, ice-cold) was added in one shot under vigorous stirring. The as-obtained nanospheres were used as the seeds for the growth of Au nanorods. In a typical process, 4.75 mL of 0.1 M CTAB, 0.2 mL of 10 mM HAuCl4 containing 7.8 MBq of H198AuCl4, and 30 L of 10 mM AgNO3 were added stepwise to a glass vial, followed by gentle mixing. The solution at this stage appeared bright brown-yellow in color. Then 32 L of 0.1 M ascorbic acid was added, and the solution became colorless upon mixing. Finally, 20 L of the seed solution was added, and the reaction mixture was gently mixed for 10 s and then left undisturbed for 3 h. The specific activities of the four samples of 198Au-incorporated nanostructures are listed in Table S1.Conjugation of PEG with Au NanostructuresFour milliliters of the Au nanostructures in ultrapurified H2O (0.050.2 mg/mL in Au content as determined by ICP-MS) was mixed with 2.0 mg of mPEG-SH and incubated overnight at room temperature. The excess mPEG-SH was removed by centrifugation, and the solids were washed three times with ultrapurified H2O to obtain the PEGylated Au nanostructures.Electron MicroscopyTo determine morphology, the nanoparticles were deposited on TEM grids and examined using a Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 120 kV (FEI, Hillsboro, OR).Tumor Mouse ModelAll animal studies were performed in compliance with guidelines set forth by the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. The EMT6 murine mammary carcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Waymouths MB 752/1 medium with 85% 2 mM l-glutamine and 15% fetal bovine serum at 37 C with 5% CO2. EMT6 cells (2 105) in 100 L saline were injected into the right flank, back, or hind flank of 7 week old female BALB/c mice weighing 1520 g. Tumors were allowed to grow for 810 days, reaching an average size of 100 mm3, before further studies were performed.In Vivo BiodistributionEMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane before 185370 kBq of 198Au-incorporated nanospheres (314 kBq, 5.27 g/mouse), nanodisks (185 kBq, 27.8 g/mouse), nanorods (326 kBq, 4.22 g/mouse), or nanocages (225 kBq, 17.9 g/mouse) (suspended in 100 L saline) was injected via the tail vein. After re-anesthetization, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation 1, 6, or 24 h after injection (n = 4 animals per time point). Organs of interest were collected, weighed, and counted in a well Beckman 8000 gamma counter (Beckman, Brea, CA). Standards were prepared and measured along with the samples to calculate percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g).In Vivo Luminescence ImagingEMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (n = 2) were anesthetized with isoflurane before 1.793.83 MBq of 198Au-incorporated nanospheres (3.83 MBq, 64.7 g/mouse), nanodisks (2.94 MBq, 442 g/mouse), nanorods (1.79 MBq, 23.1 g/mouse), or nanocages (2.48 MBq, 197 g/mouse) (suspended in 100 L saline) was injected via the tail vein. In vivo radioactive optical imaging was performed with an IVIS 100 Spectrum system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The mouse was placed in a light-tight chamber under isoflurane anesthesia, and luminescent images were acquired over 5 min at 1 and 24 h postinjection. Images were analyzed using Living Image 3.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). The optical signal was normalized to p/s/cm2/sr, and the emission intensity was normalized to the radioactivity injected.Autoradiographic ImagingTumors were excised from the mice after Cerenkov imaging and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tumors were frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound and then cut with a Vibratome 8850 whole body cryo-microtome (SIMS Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) into 820 slices, with each slice being 50 m thick. The slices were placed on glass slides for 2D autoradiography using an Instant Imager Electronic Autoradiography system (Packard, Meriden, CT). Images were acquired and analyzed with Imager software (Packard, Meriden, CT).In Vivo PA ImagingEMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (n = 6) were imaged 810 days after injection with EMT6 cells as described above. The PA imaging system was an updated version of what was used in previous publications,44,45 and it relies on the collection of photoacoustic signals generated from the absorbed laser irradiation. The light source was a tunable dye laser (Cobra, Sirah) pumped by a Nd:YLF laser (INNOSLAB, EdgeWave), providing 7 ns laser pulse width with a pulse repetition rate up to 5 kHz. The output light was coupled into a multimode fiber (M30L02, Thorlabs), passed through a conical lens, and then weakly focused by an optical condenser into the sample. The generated ultrasound signal was collected by the acoustic lens, which was in confocal arrangement with the focused laser beam, and received by a 50 MHz ultrasound transducer (V214-BB-RM, Olympus NDT). For each laser shot, a 1D depth-resolved image (A-line) was acquired without mechanical scanning. By raster-scanning along the transverse plane, a 2D image was acquired, which could be expanded to three dimensions by collecting 2D images at multiple focal planes throughout the tumor volume. Volumetric images can be viewed through either MAP or direct 3D rendering. MAP was performed by projecting the maximum signal amplitude along the z axis (depth) or other axes. A field of view of 12 mm 10 mm can be acquired within about 1 min. The lateral and axial resolution of the system were 45 and 15 m, respectively. The pulse energy at the skin surface was about 5 mJ/cm2, which is well below the standard limit regulated by the American National Standards Institute standards (ANSI Z136.1).In Vivo PET ImagingTo characterize tumor glucose uptake and hypoxia, PET imaging was performed with 18F-FDG and 64Cu-ATSM, respectively. PET and the corresponding CT images were acquired in either an Inveon microPET/CT scanner (Siemens, Munich, Germany) or a Focus 220 PET scanner (Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN). To measure glucose uptake, EMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were fasted for 4 h and anesthetized with isoflurane before 11.1 MBq of 18F-FDG acquired from the Washington University cyclotron facility was injected via the tail vein. Dynamic scans were acquired every 5 min until 1 h postinjection. Images were analyzed with Inveon software (Siemens, Munich, Germany).For hypoxia studies, ATSM was first labeled with 64Cu acquired from the Washington University cyclotron facility through a reported protocol.38 Briefly, 117 MBq of 64Cu was dissolved in 100 L of water. An aliquot of 5 mL of ATSM reconstitution solution (10% propylene glycol, 1.25% sodium acetate in sterile water) was mixed with 7.5 g of lyophilized ATSM ligand and vortexed vigorously for 1 min. Then 1 mL of the ATSM stock solution was added to the 64Cu solution and vortexed vigorously for 30 s. Radiochemical purity of the 64Cu-ATSM was tested with an Oasis cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and confirmed to be 95% before the sample was diluted with 2 mL saline. EMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and 100 L of saline containing 3 MBq of 64Cu-ATSM was injected via the tail vein. Dynamic scans were acquired every 5 min until 1 h postinjection. Images were analyzed with Inveon software (Siemens, Munich, Germany).Author Contributions These authors contributed equally to this work.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by a grant from the NCI (R01 CA138527) and startup funds from Georgia Institute of Technology.Supporting Information AvailableAdditional figures and information as described in the text.

For this therapy, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are injected intravenously and are allowed to accumulate within the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The tumor is then irradiated with a near infrared laser, whose energy is absorbed by the AuNPs and translated into heat. While reliance on the EPR effect for tumor targeting has proven adequate for vascularized tumors in small animal models, the efficiency and specificity of tumor delivery in vivo, particularly in tumors with poor blood supply, has proven challenging. In this study, we examine whether human T cells can be used as cellular delivery vehicles for AuNP transport into tumors. We first demonstrate that T cells can be efficiently loaded with 45 nm gold colloid nanoparticles without affecting viability or function (e.g. migration and cytokine production). Using a human tumor xenograft mouse model, we next demonstrate that AuNP-loaded T cells retain their capacity to migrate to tumor sites in vivo. In addition, the efficiency of AuNP delivery to tumors in vivo is increased by more than four-fold compared to injection of free PEGylated AuNPs and the use of the T cell delivery system also dramatically alters the overall nanoparticle biodistribution. Thus, the use of T cell chaperones for AuNP delivery could enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle-based therapies and imaging applications by increasing AuNP tumor accumulation.IntroductionGold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been successfully used to enable photothermal therapy (PTT) for the treatment of cancer in small animal studies [1-5], and has recently moved towards clinical application [6]. A variety of AuNPs have been examined for PTT, including silica-gold nanoshells [2], gold nanorods [7], gold nanocages [8], gold-gold sulfide nanoparticles [9], and hollow gold nanoshells [3]. These particles can be engineered to absorb light in the near infrared (NIR) range, where light is maximally transmissive and minimally absorbed by tissue. AuNP delivery can be accomplished by systemic administration (intravenous injection). The nanoparticles, depending on their shape, hydrodynamic size, and surface charge, will accumulate within the tumor via its irregular vasculature; this passive accumulation is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [10,11]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 60 nm have demonstrated the most efficient delivery to the tumor using the EPR effect [11], and more recently, the use of smaller hollow gold [3] and gold-gold sulfide nanoshells [12] (20-40 nm diameter) has further improved nanoparticle half-life in the blood. However, even with these smaller particles, the percentage of the injected dose (ID) delivered to the tumor is low [13,14], and accumulation in non-target sites such as the liver and spleen is comparatively high [13,15]. Thus, new methods aimed at improving tumor delivery and specificity may increase the tumor concentration of gold nanoparticles and ultimately the efficacy of anti-tumor PTT and enhance nanoparticle mediated imaging techniques.Attempts at augmenting gold nanoparticle tumor delivery have included a variety of nanoparticle surface modifications, including conjugation with antibodies [3] and hormone analogs [16]; however, inclusion of targeting ligands has only modestly improved tumor accumulation and specificity. This is likely due to the reliance of these nanoparticles on passive accumulation through EPR, which is highly dependent on adequate blood flow to the tumor. Therefore, tumors or tumor regions that exhibit poor vasculature and hypoxia are less likely to be effectively targeted using nanoparticles, ultimately limiting their therapeutic use. Choi et al. [17] recently demonstrated that macrophages could be used as a cellular delivery vehicle to deposit AuNPs in tumors and hypoxic tumor tissues, facilitating delivery through active cellular migration and extravasation in response to chemotactic factors produced by malignant cells. These encouraging results suggested that other immune cells might be used as cellular delivery vehicles. In this study, we assessed the capacity of activated T cells to function as chaperones for AuNPs. Unlike macrophage, T cells are readily isolated and expanded in vitro, and upon infusion, circulate throughout the body and migrate into tumors in response to tumor-associated chemokines. This tumor-tropic property permits their use as cellular vehicles for the delivery of molecular therapeutics [18-21].Combining the advantages of T cells with nanotechnology has the potential to generate innovative new approaches to cancer therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that T cells may serve as efficient drug delivery vehicles for the treatment of cancer, including transport of magnetic particles bearing doxorubicin and for use in boron neutron capture therapy [22,23]. Here we have explored whether T cells can be used as AuNP carriers to increase delivery to tumor sites in vivo using gold colloidal nanospheres (40-45 nm), comparable in size to hollow gold nanoshells and gold-gold sulfide nanoparticles used for PTT. Although gold colloid in this size range has maximal absorbance in the visible wavelengths, there are several variants of AuNPs that are of similar size (25-60 nm) and absorb optimally in the NIR region, permitting translation of this delivery method for PTT. These gold nanoparticle variants include gold-gold sulfide nanoparticles, hollow gold nanoshells, and gold nanocubes, all of which have demonstrated efficacy as PTT-mediating agents in mouse studies [24]. Additionally, there have been studies demonstrating photothermal therapy using gold colloid that has been strategically aggregated to red-shift the peak absorbance into the NIR [25,26]. The possible applications of a AuNP-T cell delivery system could further be extended to imaging and drug delivery applications, as gold nanoparticles also have demonstrated potential as scatter- and absorption-based imaging contrast agents [27-30] and drug delivery agents [31]. In this study, we demonstrate that gold colloid is readily taken up by activated human T cells without impairing their viability or cellular functions, and that following intravenous infusion into tumor bearing micecan more efficiently deliver AuNPs to distant tumor sites.ResultsLoading of activated human T cells with AuNPsSynthesized gold colloid was determined to be 40-45 nm in diameter by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1a and Figure S1 in Additional file 1). Activated and expanded human T cells were cultured in the presence of AuNPs for a period of 1 to 24 h to permit AuNP internalization. AuNP loading was confirmed using bright field and dark field microscopy demonstrating that T cells co-localize with AuNPs (Figure 1b). We further optimized loading conditions by altering AuNP concentration (per cell) and time of incubation. To determine the number of nanoparticles present per T cell, an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis was used. T cells from three different human donors were first cultured with concentrations of AuNPs ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 nM for a period of 24 h to evaluate for variability in gold nanoparticle loading due to differences in T cells from different donors (Figure 1c). A maximum of 14,900 2,400 AuNPs was internalized per T cell using a AuNP loading concentration of 0.5 nM (Figure 1c). We then performed a time course study using T cells from a single donor to determine the minimum amount of time required to load the T cells with the maximum number of AuNPs (Figure 1d). For this study, we incubated T cells with nanoparticle concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1 nM. At 24 h, the 0.5 and 1 nM groups have similar gold content, suggesting that there is a maximum amount of AuNPs that can be internalized by T cells. These results demonstrate that maximal AuNP loading of T cells can be achieved using a concentration of 0.5 nM AuNP and an incubation period of 24 h.Figure 1Gold nanoparticle uptake by human T cells.

(B) Brightfield (upper) and darkfield (lower) images of human T cells demonstrate gold nanoparticle uptake by the increased light scattering seen in the AuNP-T cell group compared to T cells alone. (C) ICP-OES analysis of T cell gold content at 24 h using different nanoparticle loading concentrations. Each point is a composite of data acquired from three different T cell donors. (D) Time course data for T cells from a single donor loaded with different concentrations of gold nanoparticles. Optimal loading occurred after 24 h at a concentration between 0.5 and 1.0 nM.AuNP-loading does not affect T cell viability or functionWe next measured T cell viability and function post-AuNP loading to assess potential toxicity that may inhibit T cell performance as an in vivo delivery vehicle. Loading T cells with AuNPs had no immediate effect on T cell viability as determined by Annexin-V/7-AAD staining (Figure 2a) and did not alter the phenotype of the cells (Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Furthermore, there were no prolonged effects on T cell proliferation as measured by thymidine incorporation (Figure 2b). Importantly, AuNPs did not affect migration when tested in a transwell chemotaxis assay against supernatant produced from human LCL tumors, suggesting that T cells retain their migratory behavior post-AuNP loading (Figure 2c). Finally, production of IFN- following mitogen activation (PMA-I) was not impaired by AuNPs (Figure 2d). These results show that AuNPs have no detrimental effects on T cell viability and function in vitro and indicate that T cell migration in vivo will likely be retained following loading.Figure 2AuNP loading has no significant effect on T cell viability or function. T cells were loaded in the presence of 0.5 nM AuNPs for 24 h or cultured in medium alone and then measured for viability using Annexin-V/PI staining (A), proliferation using thymidine incorporation (B), migration through a transwell membrane in response to tumor (LCL) produced supernatant (C) and intracellular analysis of IFN- cytokine production following mitogen stimulation (D).T cells migrate and transport AuNPs to tumors in vivoIn vivo AuNP-T cell migration to tumor sites was first examined using bioluminescent imaging and histology. T cells were first genetically modified to express firefly luciferase and then subsequently loaded with AuNPs. Bioluminescent imaging 48 h post-intravenous injection of AuNP-T cells demonstrate specific migration of the T cells to subcutaneous LCL tumors in immune deficient SCID mice (Figure 3a). This timepoint was selected based on previous studies that have demonstrated T cell localization to tumor sites 48 h post-infusion [32,33]. We next resected the tumors and performed histology to determine if AuNPs and T cells co-localized within the tumor. Immunohistochemical staining using CD3 antibody (a pan-T cell marker) demonstrated infiltration of T cells into the tumor (Figure 3b). In addition, areas of increased scatter in the darkfield images correlated well with areas of CD3+ staining. This observation demonstrates that the T cells maintain internalized AuNPs during in vivo migration to the tumor site.Figure 3AuNP-loaded T cells migrate to tumors in vivo. (A) T cells were retrovirally modified to express firefly luciferase then loaded in the presence of 0.5 nM AuNP for 24 h. Cells were subsequently injected intravenously into SCID mice bearing subcutaneous xenografted LCL tumors.

(B) Resected tumors were analyzed by bright field imaging (top row) and immunohistochemistry for human CD3 expression and dark field imaging (bottom row) to indicate the presence of AuNPs. Red arrows indicate the colocalization of CD3+ T cells and AuNPs within the tumor.Delivery of AuNPs by T cells alters nanoparticle biodistributionWe next performed a comprehensive in vivo biodistribution study using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ICP-OES to map the location of free PEGylated AuNPs (40-45 nm gold colloid coated with 5000 MW PEG) and AuNPs delivered by T cells. Prior to injection, ICP-OES was performed to determine the absolute gold dose for PEG-AuNPs and AuNP-T cells. Following intravenous injection with PEG-AuNPs or AuNP-T cells, tumors, and organs (bone, brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lungs, muscle, plasma, and spleen) were harvested and analyzed for gold levels using ICP-MS. For PEG-AuNP treated mice, organs were harvested at 4, 8, 24, and 48 h post-injection, while for AuNP-T cell treated mice, organs were harvested at 24 and 48 h (Figure 4a). Predictably, the biodistribution of AuNP-T cells is altered when compared to that of the PEG-AuNPs. As observed in previous studies [13,15], the highest percentages of AuNPs using PEG coating were delivered to the liver and spleen (5.65 and 17.03%, respectively, at 48 h, Figure 4b,c). In comparison, T cells delivered AuNPs to the lung, liver, and spleen, which received 4.76, 33.5, and 2.69% at 48 h, respectively (Figure 4b and 4c). The plasma half-life of the PEG-AuNPs was calculated to be 6.05 h, and no gold was detected in the plasma for the AuNP-T cell group, suggesting no significant AuNP leakage from the T cells during in vivo migration. The AuNP-T cell biodistribution over time correlates with the normal biodistribution of human T cells, suggesting that the presence of internalized AuNPs does not significantly change the T cell biodistribution [32]. These data suggest that cellular delivery of AuNP will result in a unique biodistribution pattern that is dependent on the cell type used for delivery.Figure 4Biodistribution comparison of AuNPs and AuNP-T cells in mice. Mice were injected with PEG-AuNPs (60-65 nm hydrodynamic diameter), AuNP-T cells, or PBS and subsequently sacrificed at various time points to determine biodistribution. PBS gold levels were negligible in comparison to AuNP and AuNP-T cell groups for all organs. Values are percentage of the injected gold dose (%ID) were calculated from ICP-MS and are normalized for dry weight differences. The AuNP-T cell group exhibited significantly higher gold delivery to the lungs, liver, and bone, while the AuNP group demonstrated higher gold levels within the small intestine. No significant differences were seen in the spleen, kidney, muscle, or brain. An asterisk indicates statistically significant (P 0.05) differences.T cell delivery increases tumor accumulation of AuNPsCloser examination of LCL tumors following treatment with either PEG-AuNPs or AuNP-T cells showed an increase in AuNP delivery to tumors following cellular transport. For PEG-AuNPs, the highest level of accumulation in tumors was observed at 24 h post-injection, while peak tumor gold accumulation following T cell delivery was seen at 48 h. Using PEG-AuNP, ICP-MS analysis of gold content of excised tumor tissue showed that 0.39 0.33% of ID reached the tumor at 24 h. Whereas, using AuNP-T cells, 1.55 0.72% of the ID localized to the tumor at 48 h (P 0.01) (Figure 5). This represents a four-fold increase in the efficiency of AuNP delivery to the tumor site using T cells as vehicles.Figure 5AuNP-T cells enhance the delivery of gold nanoparticles to the tumor site in vivo. Tumor-bearing mice were injected i.v. with PEG-AuNPs or AuNP-T cells. Tumors were subsequently resected at various time points and measured for AuNP content using ICP-MS. Values displayed represent the percentage of injected gold normalized for tumor dry weight differences (mean SEM). The percentage of gold delivered by the AuNP-T cells at 48 h represents a significant, four-fold increase over the PEG-AuNP group at 24 h (P 0.01).DiscussionOne of the greatest challenges of translating nanotechnologies to the clinical realm is optimizing in vivo delivery. Maximizing AuNP accumulation at the tumor site has the potential to enhance photothermal cancer therapy, as well as other applications such as optical imaging. In this study, we show that human T cells can be used to transport AuNPs to distant tumor sites following intravenous administration. Following short term incubation with AuNPs, T cells can be efficiently loaded with over 14,000 AuNPs per cell without affecting cell viability, proliferation, and cytokine production. Importantly, T cells loaded with AuNPs retain their ability to migrate in vitro, and demonstrate tumor-specific homing in mice. Using T cells as a vehicle to deliver AuNPs resulted in a four-fold increase in the efficiency of AuNP tumor accumulation, demonstrating that active transport of AuNPs by cellular chaperones is superior to that of passive accumulation through the EPR effect.Stephan et al. [33] recently demonstrated that synthetic drug-carrier nanoparticles could be stably conjugated to the surface of immune cells, including T cells, for delivery of therapeutic molecules. In these studies, T cells efficiently carried surface-tethered nanoparticles to tumors in mice, and when loaded with cytokines to support T cell growth, dramatically increased antitumor efficacy. However, our study conclusively demonstrates in vivo that internal loading of AuNPs in T cells can improve tumor localization, and thus may be a useful technology for a variety of nanoparticle based therapies.In this study, we elect to use AuNPs. AuNPs are known to have low cytotoxicity, and gold has been used in humans for the treatment of arthritis for over 50 years [34], which makes AuNPs a logical choice in the pursuit of clinical applications. For this study, 40-45 nm gold colloidal nanospheres were selected for internalization by activated human T cells. The internalization of nanoparticles by cells is believed to be accomplished predominantly by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and particle size is an important variable in determining the kinetics of cellular uptake, with maximal uptake in a size range of 40-50 nm [35,36]. We selected the size of our AuNPs for this proof-of-concept delivery study to optimize nanoparticle cellular uptake. We modulated the degree of nanoparticle internalization by altering the concentration of nanoparticles incubated with the T cells (Figure 1c). We also evaluated nanoparticle uptake using T cells isolated from three different human donors (Figure 1c) and saw only small variation, suggesting that this technique could be extrapolated to the T cells of any patient.The internalized gold colloid used in this study also had no detrimental impact on the viability or function of activated human T cells in vitro (Figure 2), and the T cells were able to migrate to tumors in vivo while maintaining their AuNP payload (Figure 3). In addition to their ability to carry AuNPs to tumors, T cells can be selected for tumor-specificity for adoptive immunotherapy studies [37-39]. Furthermore, T cells may be genetically engineered to improve their function [40,41] or enhance their ability to migrate to tumors in vivo[42,43]. It has been demonstrated that systemically administered AuNPs tend to accumulate mainly in the perivascular regions of the tumor [11], limiting passive accumulation of nanoparticles by the EPR effect to well-vascularized regions of the tumor. T cells may naturally localize to tumors, and tumor-specific T cell clones have been demonstrated to penetrate into the hypoxic cores of the tumors in vivo [44]. The more extensive infiltration of tumor sites by antigen-specific T cells may permit enhanced penetration of the tumor when compared to freely-injected nanoparticles, potentially augmenting therapeutic efficacy.The use of T cell vehicles also significantly affects nanoparticle biodistribution (Figure 4). Freely injected nanoparticles (40-45 nm gold colloidal nanospheres coated with 5000 MW PEG) accumulate most significantly in well-vascularized organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, and gut (Figure 4). Maximal AuNP tumor accumulation for the freely injected PEG-AuNP group is seen at 24 h (Figure 5). After 24 h, increased gold content for the PEG-AuNP group is seen in the spleen, liver, and kidney with a corresponding decrease in gold content within the tumor and other organs, which represents a shift towards AuNP clearance.AuNP-T cells present a much different biodistribution from the systemically administered nanoparticles that correlates with the expected biodistribution of T cells. After adoptive transfer of AuNP-T cells, a large percentage of the ID is seen within the liver and lungs at 24 h. T cells are known to accumulate within the liver and lungs after administration due to the vascularity and number of adhesion molecules present in these organs [45]. This pattern of T cell migration is consistent with the biodistribution of adoptively transferred T cells seen in previous studies [33,45]. AuNP-T cells are also seen accumulating in the spleen and bone of the mice; these locations are also normal reservoirs of T cells [46]. The large number of AuNP-T cells seen in the liver likely represents apoptotic T cells. This large accumulation is not observed by bioluminescence imaging in Figure 3, and the liver is a known site where apoptotic T cells are entrapped [47]. Tumor accumulation of AuNP-T cells increases from 24 to 48 h as T cells escape from the lungs and migrate to the tumor (Figure 5). The biodistribution of AuNP-T cells matches the expected biodistribution of normal activated T cells, suggesting that AuNP biodistribution can be modulated based on the selection of the cellular vehicle. In the case of T cells, it is possible that the biodistribution may be altered to to further favor tumor accumulation and persistence by manipulating cell culture conditions [45] or by genetic modification of T cells [43].Using T cells as cellular vehicles for AuNP delivery, we achieve a four-fold increase in tumor delivery efficiency at 48 h when compared to freely injected PEG-coated AuNPs at 24 h (Figure 5). This represents a significant increase in delivery efficiency (P 0.01, Student's t-test) using T cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that T cells can be used to enhance AuNP delivery to a tumor in vivo. The use of AuNPs and T cells together combines the photothermal therapy and imaging advantages of AuNPs with the immunotherapy and biodistribution advantages of T cells. Future directions will focus on utilizing the AuNP-T cell system for cancer therapy by modifying the T cells to further enrich AuNP tumor accumulation and enhance anti-tumor effects.ConclusionsIn this study we demonstrate the internalization of AuNPs into activated human T cells for the delivery of nanoparticles in vivo. AuNP uptake has no negative impact on T cell viability, proliferation, or immune function, and T cells are able to transport the AuNP payload to tumor sites in vivo. Furthermore, the use of T cells as a AuNP vehicle enhances in vivo delivery efficiency by four-fold. This delivery method alters the biodistribution of gold compared to freely injected AuNPs, and demonstrates that the selection of a particular cellular vehicle may dictate AuNP biodistribution.MethodsAuNP synthesis and PEGylationGold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4 3H2O 99%) and potassium carbonate anhydrous (K2CO3 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Deionized water was provided by a Milli-Q system. In this synthesis method, Au3+ is reduced to Au0 using CO as a reducing agent. A 0.38 mM HAuCl4 solution was prepared and aged in an amber bottle at 4C for a minimum of 72 h prior to use. After aging the chloroauric acid solution, the temperature was allowed to gradually rise to 16C. A 1.8 mM K2CO3 solution was then prepared by adding 75 mg of K2CO3 to the aged 200 mL HAuCl4 solution. This solution was aged for 30 min prior to aeration with CO gas. A 40 mL volume of the aged solution was added to the beaker and stirred continuously prior to aeration. CO gas (Matheson-Trigas) was injected into the continuously stirring solution at a flow rate of 30.5 mL/min. The CO flow was controlled via a flow rate control valve. A visible color change from clear to dark purple to red is observed during synthesis, indicating formation of AuNPs. TEM images were taken to confirm size and monodispersity. Particles were sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 m polyethersulfone filter. To stabilize the particles in preparation for mouse injection, 0.5 mM polyethylene glycol-thiol (PEG-SH, MW = 5 kD, Nektar) was added to the particles. After a 24-h incubation, excess PEG-SH was removed by centrifugation and PEGylated particle stability was confirmed by increasing solution tonicity with 1 M NaCl. Dynamic light scattering measurements were taken to assess the hydrodynamic diameter of the PEGylated gold colloid.T cell isolation and preparationPeripheral blood was obtained with informed consent from willing healthy donors using a Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Oslow, Norway). PBMC were used to generate EBV-transformed B cells lines (LCL) and T cell lines. LCL and T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For T cell expansion, non-tissue culture treated 24-well plates were coated with OKT3 (1 g/mL; Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Raritan, NJ) and anti-CD28 antibody (1 g/mL; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4C. Plates were washed and 2 106 PBMC were plated per well in complete RPMI supplemented with 100 U/mL recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2). On day 3, T cell blasts were harvested and further expanded or transduced in IL-2 supplemented media.T cell internalization of AuNPsDay 7 OKT3 blasts were harvested and suspended in complete RPMI supplemented with IL-2 and 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 nM of AuNPs for 24 h (1 mole = 6.022 1023 nanoparticles). Cells were harvested and washed a minimum of three times using 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to subsequent experiments. To confirm loading, T cells were imaged using darkfield microscopy. To quantitatively characterize loading, 2 106 T cells per sample were prepared for ICP-OES analysis by digesting the cells in three parts trace metal grade hydrochloric acid (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and one part trace metal grade nitric acid (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) overnight. Samples were then diluted to 10 mL in distilled water and filtered. T cells incubated with media alone were used as a control.T cell viability and functionality after AuNP loadingTo determine the effect of AuNP loading on T cell phenotype, we used the following monoclonal antibodies conjugated to FITC, PE, PerCP, or APC (BD Biosciences): CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD56, CD62L, CCR5, and CCR7. An Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences) was used to determine T cell viability post-AuNP loading. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FCSExpress software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA). A [3H] thymidine incorporation assay was used to assess the effects of AuNP loading on T cell proliferation. Following AuNP loading, T cells were seeded in triplicate into 96-well round bottom plates at 1 105 cells per well in complete RPMI containing 100 U/mL IL-2 for 24 h. T cells were then pulsed with 5 Ci [3H] thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) overnight. Cells were then harvested onto glass filter strips and analyzed using a TriCarb 2500 RT -counter (Packard Biosciences, Downers Grove, IL). To determine if AuNP-loaded T cells retain the ability to migrate in vitro, we used a transwell migration assay. T cells were labeled with 50 Ci Chromium51 (Cr51; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and 1.5 105 cells were placed in the upper chamber of 24-well 6.5 mm diameter, 5 m pore size transwell chambers (Costar Transwell, Corning, NY). Media alone or LCL tumor supernatant was placed in the bottom chamber. Plates were then incubated for 3 h at 37C. Cells in the bottom chamber were then harvested and analyzed using a -counter (Cobra Quantum, Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT). Specific migration was calculated using the following equation: Specific Migration (%) = (Experimental [LCL supernatant] - Spontaneous [media alone])/(Maximum [1.5 105 cells] - Spontaneous [media alone]) 100. To measure the ability of AuNP-loaded T cells to secrete IFN- following mitogenic stimulation, 2 105 T cells were seeded into 96-well round bottom plates for 24 h. T cells were then stimulated with 25 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1 g/mL Ionomycin (I; Sigma-Aldrich). Following 2 h of PMA-I stimulation, Brefeldin A (Sigma) was added to allow for intracellular cytokine retention. Four hours later, cells were permeabilized using 1% Saponin (Sigma) and IFN- expression was detected by intracellular cytokine staining using PE-conjugated anti-IFN- monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences).In vivo delivery studiesSCID xenograft modelIn vivo migration, AuNP delivery, and biodistribution studies were performed using severe combined immune deficient mice (SCID [strain ICR-Prkdc(scid)]; Taconic, Hudson, NY). All mouse experiments were performed under a Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol. 1 107 LCL tumor cells were resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the shaved right flanks of mice. Tumors were allowed to establish and grow to at least 0.5 mm 0.5 mm in size (2-3 weeks) before use.Mouse injections and sample collectionTo prepare AuNP-T cell injections, T cells were prepared as above and incubated with 0.5 nM AuNPs for 24 h. Cells were harvested and washed extensively using 1 PBS prior to injection. For delivery studies, mice received either PBS, 1 107 AuNP-T cells, or 1 1011 PEGylated AuNPs via the tail vein in a 200 L bolus. These dosages were selected based on previous in vivo studies using AuNPs and adoptively transferred T cells. To determine optimal time points for delivery analysis, tumors were resected at either 4, 8, 24, or 48 h for the PEGylated AuNP group and 24 or 48 h for the AuNP-T cell group. In addition, plasma as well as portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys, small intestine, muscle, heart, lung, bone, and brain were also collected for analysis at 4, 8, or 24 h for the PEGylated AuNP group and 24 or 48 h for the AuNP-T cell group. All tissues, including tumors, were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen after collection and stored at -80C until analysis.Bioluminescent imagingTo determine if AuNP-loaded T cells can migrate to tumors in vivo and thereby deliver AuNP to the tumor site, T cells were transduced with retrovirus encoding GFPluc as previously described by our group [48]. Transduced cells were then loaded with AuNPs for 24 h then injected intravenously (i.v.) via the tail vein (1 107 T cells per mouse). Forty-eight hours post-T cell infusion, the biodistribution of T cells was visualized using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS; Xenogen) following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Xenogen, Alameda, CA).Ex vivo tissue analysis and imagingTo image AuNP-T cells within the tumor, tumors were thawed in a 37C water bath and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrence, CA) using dry ice. The embedded tissue was then sectioned into 8 m slices using a cryostat, dried overnight at room temperature, and stored at -80C. Tissue sections were then fixed with acetone and stained for CD3 using anti-CD3 (Abcam ab5690, Cambridge, MA) as the primary antibody and the Invitrogen Histostain Plus Broad Spectrum (AEC) kit. Slides were coverslipped with immunomount (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and imaged by bright field and dark field microscopy. Resected mouse tissues were prepared and analyzed for gold content using ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Samples were lyophilized and weighed, then digested and prepared as previously described. Samples of the AuNP-T cell and AuNP boluses were also analyzed to confirm the amount of gold systemically administered.Statistical methodsFor the biodistribution analysis, we performed a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's method. Each organ was examined individually at various time points for each treatment group (n = 3 for all time points and treatment groups). Significance was set at P 0.05. An asterisk indicates significant differences between every possible AuNP:AuNP-T cell comparison pair at all time points for each organ. For the tumor delivery analysis, we used a Student's t-test to compare AuNP systemic administration to AuNP-T cell delivery. For this study, n = 8 for the AuNP group, while n = 11 for the AuNP-T cell group.AbbreviationsAuNPs: gold nanoparticles; EPR: enhanced permeability and retention; FCS: fetal calf serum; ICP-MS: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; ICP-OES: inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry; ID: injected dose; i.p., intraperitoneal; i.v., intravenous; NIR: near infrared; O.C.T.: optimal cutting temperature; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PMA: phorbol myristate acetate; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PTT: photothermal therapy; PEG: polyethylene glycol; s.c., subcutaneous; TEM: transmission electron microscopy.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsLK and AB performed the in vitro and in vivo characterizations of the AuNPs, the mouse studies, the tumor histology, the ICP-MS and ICP-OES analyses, and drafted the manuscript.

Choice of the optimal shape of gold nanorods which relates optical properties and in vivo biodistribution is important for their applications. In the present study, to investigate the relationship between the shape of gold nanorods and their biodistribution after intravenous injection, we first prepared two types of gold nanorods that had distinct aspect ratios but had the same volume, zeta potential, and PEG density on the gold surface. Biodistributions of the two types of gold nanorods after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice were then compared. Although a slight difference in accumulation in the spleen was observed, no significant difference was observed in the liver, lung, kidney, and tumors. These results suggest that biodistribution of the gold nanorods in the aspect ratio range of 1.7 to 5.0, diameter of 10 to 50 nm, and volume of approximately 4103 nm3 was dependent mainly on surface characteristics, PEG density, and zeta potential.Aspect ratioGold nanoparticlesGold nanorodsLaserBiodistributionBackgroundGold nanorods are tiny, rod-shaped gold particles. They have two distinctive different absorption bands derived from the transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of free electrons in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions, respectively [1,2]. Gold nanorods absorb NIR light, which is suitable for in vivo applications such as imaging and for photoradiation therapy because of maximal penetration of light into tissues [3]. Gold nanorods have a photothermal effect, i.e., the adsorbed light energy is converted to heat [4]. Therefore, gold nanorods are expected to be contrast agents for NIR imaging and exothermic nanodevices for photothermal therapy.Gold nanorods are prepared in the presence of the cationic detergent 1-hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (cetyltrimethylammonium chloride; CTAB), which acts as a stabilizer of gold nanorods. To apply gold nanorods as medical nanodevices, biocompatible gold nanorods have been prepared by coating with phosphatidylcholine [5] or by modifying gold nanorods with polyethylene glycol (PEG) [6,7]. PEG-modified gold nanorods show high dispersion stability, high circulation stability in the blood after intravenous injection into mice [7], and accumulation in tumors mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [8,9]. The PEG-modified gold nanorods have been applied to NIR imaging and photodynamic/photothermal therapy of tumors [8,10-13].The size and aspect ratio of gold nanorods are important factors of their uptake into cells [14-16] and biodistribution [17-20]. Arnida et al. reported that rod-shaped gold nanoparticles accumulated more efficiently in tumors and less efficiently in the liver compared with sphere-shaped gold nanoparticles [20]. However, the compared gold nanorods and gold nanospheres had different volumes and zeta potentials that affected cellular uptake (e.g., phagocytosis) [21]. Therefore, if we examine the effect of the geometry of gold nanoparticles on biodistribution, other parameters should be equivalent.In the present study, we prepared two types of gold nanorods that had distinct aspect ratios but had an identical volume, zeta potential, and surface structure. Biodistributions of these nanorods after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice were then compared.MethodsAnimalsAnimal experiments were undertaken according to the Guidelines for Animal Care and Use Committee, Kyushu University (Fukuoka, Japan). Male ddY mice (Kyudo Co., Ltd., Saga, Japan) aged 5 to 6 weeks were used. Mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment at 24C with a 12-h light-dark cycle. They were provided with drinking water and food ad libitum.Preparation of gold nanorods of lower aspect ratio from higher onesGold nanorods prepared by our research team were obtained from Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) and Dai Nippon Toryo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) [22]. The mean length and width of the as-obtained gold nanorods were 49.69.7 nm and 10.63.2 nm, respectively (aspect ratio, 5.01.2). A suspension of gold nanorods containing CTAB was stored at a constant temperature (37C). Gold nanorods were modified with PEG chains. Briefly, the gold nanorods in the suspension were centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at room temperature, decanted, and re-suspended in water to remove excess CTAB. Thiol-terminated mPEG solution (molecular weight approximately 5,000 Da; NOF Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was added to the gold nanorod suspension at a PEG/gold molar ratio of 1.0. The mixture of PEG solution and gold nanorod suspension at a final gold concentration of 1 mM was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. NIR pulsed laser light (Nd:YAG 1064 nm, 750 mW, 20 Hz, approximately 6 mm in beam diameter) irradiated the mixture for 5 min. The mean length and width of gold nanorods irradiated with the NIR pulsed laser light were 27.08.2 nm and 17.23.7 nm, respectively (aspect ratio, 1.70.9). A control mixture was not irradiated with the NIR pulsed laser light. These mixtures were stirred for another 24 h at room temperature and centrifuged twice at 14,000g for 10 min at room temperature, decanted, and re-suspended in water to remove remaining CTAB and excess PEG reagent.Characterization of PEG-modified gold nanorodsThe absorption spectra of gold nanorods in the visible-to-NIR light regions were measured with a V-670 spectrophotometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Gold nanorods and the PEG layer on the gold nanorods were imaged with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2010, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) after staining the PEG layer with 1% phosphotungstic acid [23]. Particle size distribution, surface area, and volume were calculated from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 100 particles. Amounts of PEG modified on the gold nanorods were evaluated by elemental analyses according to our previous publication [24]. Zeta potentials of gold nanorod suspensions in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were evaluated using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK).Biodistribution of gold nanorodsTumor-bearing mice were used in biodistribution experiments and were prepared as follows: Colon-26 cells: mouse colon carcinoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 g/mL amphotericin B. Cells were incubated at 37C under a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Incubated colon-26 cells were injected subcutaneously into the abdomen at 2106 cells in 100 L of Hank's balanced salt solution per mouse (ddY, male, 5 weeks, 29 to 35 g). They were allowed to grow for 5 days, wherein the tumors reached approximately 5 to 7 mm in diameter. PEG-modified gold nanorods were injected into tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein. Doses of PEG-modified gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of 5.0 and PEG-modified gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of 1.7 were at 1.01 and 1.05 mM of gold concentration in 10 L/g body weight of 5% glucose solution, respectively. Mice were sacrificed 72 h after injection. Several hundred microliters of blood were collected from the heart and immediately mixed with 1 mg ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid. The liver, lung, spleen, and kidney, as well as tumors, were collected. These samples were added to approximately 4 mL aqua regia and then heated overnight at 90C to 100C. Samples were diluted in 0.5 M HCl to the appropriate volume. Gold concentrations were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using an Agilent 7500c system (Agilent. Tokyo, Japan). ICP-MS measurement was done with thallium as the internal standard.Results and discussionPreparation of PEG-modified gold nanorods with distinct aspect ratiosTo clarify the effect of the aspect ratio of gold nanorods on biodistribution in mice, we prepared PEG-modified gold nanorods with distinct aspect ratios. Gold nanorods can be melted and reshaped by irradiation with NIR pulsed laser light at the absorption wavelength of the gold nanorods [24-26]. Based on those reports, the original gold nanorods with higher aspect ratio were transformed to those of lower aspect ratio by irradiation with laser light. After irradiation, maximum absorption and the wavelength at the maximum absorption of the gold nanorods in the NIR region decreased and shifted towards a shorter wavelength (Figure 1). TEM images revealed that the irradiated gold nanorods showed mainly spherical or elliptical shapes and partly rod shapes (Figure 2). For gold nanorods with and without irradiation, PEG modified on the gold nanorods was confirmed from a gray layer of PEG stained with phosphotungstic acid. Particle sizes of gold nanorods in the TEM images were measured; then, their distributions were plotted (Figures 3A, B). Laser irradiation made the size of the short axis of the gold nanorod increase and the size of the long axis decrease. As a result, the size distribution of the short and long axes overlapped. Aspect ratios were calculated and then plotted (Figure 3C). Half of the irradiated gold nanorods were transformed to a spherical shape (aspect ratio, 1.0). The other irradiated gold nanorods were transformed to an elliptical shape.

Closed and open bars show the size distributions of the short and long axes of gold nanorods, respectively. (C) Aspect ratios of PEG-modified gold nanorods without (closed bars) and with (open bars) pulsed laser light.Several characteristics of the gold nanorods are summarized in Table 1. The particle length of the short axis and long axis increased from 10.6 to 17.2 nm and decreased from 49.6 to 27.0 nm by laser irradiation, respectively. Laser irradiation made the aspect ratio decrease from 5.0 to 1.7. The surface area and volume of the gold nanorods were calculated on the assumption that a nanoparticle with an aspect ratio of 1.0 was a sphere and a nanorod with an aspect ratio 1.0 was a cylinder with a hemisphere domain at both ends. The surface area decreased from 1.61103 nm2 to 1.42103 nm2 by laser irradiation. The volume did not change significantly after irradiation. Previously, it was reported that irradiation of gold nanorods by pulsed laser light caused fragmentation into smaller particles [26] or fusion into larger particles [27,28]. However, in the irradiation condition described here, neither fragmentation nor fusion of the gold nanorods was observed in TEM images. This was probably because the intensity of the pulsed laser light was not sufficient to induce fragmentation of the gold nanorods, and the PEG layer on the gold nanorods disturbed the fusion between gold nanorods.

The number of modified PEG molecules on one particle decreased from 9.50102 to 8.25102 by laser irradiation. The actual release of PEG from the gold surface to supernatant has been already confirmed at a similar condition in our previous report [24]. However, the area occupied by one PEG molecule as PEG density on the gold nanorods and the zeta potentials of the gold nanorods did not change after laser irradiation. These data suggested that the laser irradiation of gold nanorods resulted in transformation from a rod shape to a spherical shape without changing the volume, PEG density, or zeta potential.Biodistribution in tumor-bearing miceWe compared the biodistribution of PEG-modified gold nanorods with distinct aspect ratios but with the same volume, PEG density, and zeta potentials. Prepared gold nanorods with aspect ratios of 5.0 and 1.7 were injected intravenously into tumor-bearing mice to which colon-26 cells were subcutaneously injected. Mice were sacrificed 72 h after the injection, and the collected organs were dissolved using aqua regia. At this time point, it has been already shown that little amount of PEG-modified gold nanorods was observed in the blood and that most gold nanorods were distributed to organs [7,9]. Gold concentrations in the samples were measured by ICP-MS. Both types of injected gold nanorods accumulated mainly in the liver and spleen (Figure 4A). Most gold nanorods with aspect ratios of 5.0 and 1.7 were probably cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the liver and spleen [28]. Figure 4 Biodistribution of PEG-modified gold nanorods in tumor-bearing mice. The biodistribution of PEG-modified gold nanorods at 72 h after intravenous injection was compared. Closed bars and open bars indicate the biodistribution of PEG-modified gold nanorods at aspect ratios of 5.0 (n=5) and 1.7 (n=4), respectively. (A) The percentage of injected dose per organ and (B) percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue or milliliter of blood, respectively. Bars are the standard error from the mean.Figure 4B shows the concentration of accumulated gold nanorods in the organs as percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue or milliliter of blood. The concentration is an important parameter for photothermal therapy and bioimaging mediated by gold nanorods. Accumulation of gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of 1.7 in the spleen was slightly lower than that of gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of 5.0, although statistical significance was low (0.1p0.05; Figure 4B). In the case of the liver, lung, and kidney, no difference between the gold nanorods with aspect ratios of 1.7 and 5.0 was observed. No difference was observed in the tumors, suggesting that a change in the shape of the gold nanorods was not sufficient to influence the EPR effect in the tumors. The slight difference observed in the spleen may have been due to physical filtration in this organ as observed for larger particles (200 nm) [29,30]. It may not have been due to changes in the contribution of the RES in the spleen because a significant difference in the accumulation in the liver (where many Kupffer cells (macrophage-like cells) constitute the RES at sinusoids) was not observed. These results suggested that the shape of the gold nanorods barely affected the biodistribution of gold nanorods after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice except for that in the spleen (though the change in biodistribution was slight). Previously, we compared biodistributions of several types of gold nanorods, which have different zeta-potentials and PEG densities on the gold surface but have the same aspect ratio [8,9]. In those studies, the surface structure of the gold nanorods strongly affected their biodistributions after intravenous injection. Therefore, it can be concluded that the biodistribution would be more affected primarily by the surface characteristics of the gold nanorods than the aspect ratio.ConclusionsIn the present study, the shape of the original gold nanorods was changed by irradiation with NIR light to a spherical form. Then, we obtained two types of PEG-modified gold nanorods with distinct aspect ratios but with the same volume, PEG density, and zeta potential. The change in the aspect ratio of the gold nanorods did not affect the biodistribution appreciably. These results suggest that the biodistribution of gold nanorods in the aspect ratio range of 1.7 to 5.0 and size of 10 to 50 nm at a volume of approximately 4103 nm3 is dependent mainly on the surface characteristics, PEG density, and zeta potential. If the application of gold nanorods to therapeutic use is considered, the gold nanorods circulating in the blood or other tissues such as tumors are irradiated with NIR light. Irradiation with the pulsed laser light will induce the shape change of the gold nanorods and release of molecules bound on the gold nanorods without changing their biodistribution. On the other hand, irradiation with continuous wave laser light can heat the gold nanorods continuously without changing the shape of the gold nanorods [24]. Thus, combinations of gold nanorods and different modes of light irradiation provide us various drug delivery/release and heating systems, and it will be an advantage of gold nanorods over other types of nanoparticles. The results obtained in this study will be used as basic information on the in vivo application not only of gold nanorods with various aspect ratios, but also of other types of anisotropic nanoparticles.AbbreviationsCTAB: cetyltrimethylammonium chloride 1-hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride; EPR: enhanced permeability and retention; ICP-MS: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; NIR: near infrared; PEG: polyethylene glycol.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors contributionsYA designed and carried out all the experiments and drafted the manuscript.

An anti-cancer drug (i.e., doxorubicin (DOX)) was covalently conjugated onto PEGylated (PEG: polyethylene glycol) GNR nanocarriers via a hydrazone bond to achieve pH-sensitive controlled drug release. Tumor-targeting ligands (i.e., the cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys) peptides, cRGD) and 64Cu-chelators (i.e., 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N, N', N''-triacetic acid (NOTA)) were conjugated onto the distal ends of the PEG arms to achieve active tumor-targeting and PET imaging, respectively. Based on flow cytometry analysis, cRGD-conjugated nanocarriers (i.e., GNR-DOX-cRGD) exhibited a higher cellular uptake and cytotoxicity than non-targeted ones (i.e., GNR-DOX) in vitro. However, GNR-DOX-cRGD and GNR-DOX nanocarriers had similar in vivo biodistribution according to in vivo PET imaging and biodistribution studies. Due to the unique optical properties of GNRs, this multifunctional GNR-based nanoplatform can potentially be optimized for combined cancer therapies (chemotherapy and photothermal therapy) and multimodality imaging (PET, optical, X-ray computed tomography (CT), etc.).Gold nanorod (GNR)drug deliverynanoparticlescancerpositron emission tomography (PET)cRGD peptidetumor targetingIntroductionCancer continues to be one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases each year 1-3. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy which face formidable challenges as they often cause collateral, debilitating, and adverse effects to the patients 4. Nanotechnology provides extraordinary opportunities to address these challenges as nanocarriers can offer both passive and active targeting abilities towards cancerous tissues/cells 5-7. Passive tumor targeting ability is attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect exhibited by tumor tissues which allows the nanocarriers to preferentially accumulate in the tumor tissue 3, 5. Active tumor-targeting ability can be achieved by conjugating certain tumor-targeting ligands such as peptides, antibodies, and aptamers that can recognize and bind specifically to receptors that are overexpressed by cancer cells 5, 7-9. Moreover, many of the pharmacologic properties of free drugs including poor water solubility and in vivo stability can be improved by nanocarriers. Drug nanocarriers can also provide a stimuli-responsive drug release profile at the pathological site thereby optimizing the pharmacokinetics of the drug and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy 3, 5-7, 10-16.Over the past two decades, great strides have been made in the design and application of nanomedicine. A number of therapeutic nanocarriers have already been approved for clinical use 3, 17. The current focus of nanomedicine is to develop multifunctional tumor-targeting drug/agent nanocarriers, including those capable of co-delivering anti-cancer drugs and imaging contrast agents which are termed cancer theranostics (i.e., combined therapy and diagnostics), thereby providing a more effective and multimodal approach to cancer management 6, 7, 18-20.Molecular imaging has been extensively studied for cancer detection and staging, as well as the evaluation of the in vivo biodistribution of various nanoparticles/nanocarriers 21-23. Among them, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become increasingly popular in both preclinical and clinical settings as it offers excellent sensitivity for deep tissues, higher detection efficiency, and non-invasiveness 24, 25. Nevertheless, there is not a single modality that is sufficient to collect all necessary information for a particular assessment. For example, PET imaging has poor spatial resolution. Thus, multimodality imaging is often applied in clinical oncology 22, 24-27. Recently, optical imaging has emerged as a complement to radionuclide-based imaging techniques as it offers convenient, non-invasive, non-radioactive, real-time, and high-resolution imaging of diseased tissues 21, 28. Particularly, near-infrared (NIR; 700-1,000 nm) fluorescence imaging is potentially a very useful secondary imaging modality to complement PET imaging as NIR light can penetrate several centimeters of tissue. This is because light absorption by endogenous chromophores in native tissue is minimized in the NIR region 21, 28, 29. Gold nanorods (GNRs) with suitable aspect ratios can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region, which can be used for enhanced optical imaging and photothermal cancer therapy 30-33. In fact, due to its tunable optical properties (dependent upon the aspect ratio) and chemical versatility, GNRs have been explored for a broad spectrum of biomedical applications including drug/gene delivery and photothermal therapy, as well as computed tomography (CT) and/or optical imaging 21, 30-32, 34-36.Herein, we report a multifunctional and water-soluble GNR-based nanoplatform that integrates chemotherapy, PET imaging, and molecular targeting into one system (Figure 1). Doxorubicin (DOX), a model anticancer drug, was conjugated onto the GNR via a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond to achieve a pH-responsive drug release profile. A cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide was conjugated selectively to the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) terminal ends, which can specifically bind to integrin v3 that is overexpressed on sprouting tumor vessels and many tumor cells 37-39. 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N, N', N''-triacetic acid (NOTA), a macrocyclic 64Cu (t1/2: 12.7 h) chelator, was selectively conjugated onto the distal ends of the PEG arms for PET imaging, which is used to non-invasively and quantitatively monitor the in vivo biodistribution and tumor-targeting efficacy of the GNR-based nanocarriers.Materials and methodsMaterialsHAuCl4.3H2O (99.9%), NaBH4 (99%), L-ascorbic acid (AA, 99+%), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%), AgNO3 (99+%), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aminoethanethiol hydrochloride (AET.HCl), methyl thioglycolate (MTG), anhydrous hydrazine, 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and used without further purification. Triethylamine (TEA) and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and were distilled before use. The heterobifunctional PEG derivative, R (R = maleimide or methoxy)-PEG114-NHS (Mw: 5000) was purchased from JenKem Technology (Allen, TX, USA). The anti-cancer drug, doxorubicinHCl (DOX), was purchased from Tecoland Corporation (Irvine, CA, USA). Cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys) (c(RGDfC)) peptide was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY, USA). p-SCN-Bn-NOTA was purchased from Macrocyclics, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) was purchased from Gibco BRL (Carlsbad, CA, USA). U87MG human glioblastoma cells (expressing high levels of integrin v3 40) were purchased from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All other chemicals and reagents used were of analytical reagent grade. Phosphate and acetate buffered solutions were prepared in our laboratory. Ultrapure deionized water (DI water, Milli-Q Water Systems) was used for all solution preparations and experiments. Glassware used for preparing GNRs was cleaned by soaking in aqua regia followed by washing with DI water. During 64Cu-labeling, water and all buffers used were of Millipore grade and pre-treated with Chelex 100 resin (50-100 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to ensure that the aqueous solution was heavy-metal free. PD-10 desalting columns were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA). 64Cu was produced via a 64Ni(p,n)64Cu reaction using a cyclotron at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 41.Synthesis of bare GNRsBare GNRs were prepared via the well-established two-step seed-mediated growth method with a slight modification 42, 43. Briefly, 600 L of ice-cold 10 mM NaBH4 solution was quickly added to 250 L of 0.01 M auric acid (HAuCl4) dissolved in a 0.1 M CTAB surfactant solution. The solution was stirred for 2 min. Afterwards, it was allowed to react for 2 h to form the CTAB-capped Au nanoparticles to be used as seeds for the synthesis of GNRs. To synthesize the GNRs, 95 mL of CTAB solution (0.1 M) was added to a 200 mL flask. Afterwards, 950 L of AgNO3 solution (0.01 M) mixed in 5 mL of HAuCl4 solution (0.01 M) was added to the CTAB solution. Subsequently, 550 L of freshly prepared AA solution (0.1 M) were added to the above mixture as a weak reducing agent. After swirling for 3 min, the gold color disappeared which indicated the reduction of Gold (III) to Gold (I). Lastly, 100 L of CTAB-capped Au nanoparticle seeds were added. The solution was left standing overnight. The resulting GNRs were separated from the reaction solution via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 12 minutes, washed with deionized water twice to remove any residual reactants, and separated from water via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for about 15 minutes using a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26-XPI centrifuge (Beckman, Germany).Synthesis of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) and aminoethanethiol (AET) conjugated GNRsIn order to conjugate PEG and DOX onto the GNR, MTG and AET linkers were first anchored to the surface of the GNR. The feed molar ratio of GNR: MTG: AET was 1: 2,000: 2,000. 20 L of the MTG and AET mixture (both at 1 mM) was added to 10 mL of 1 nM GNRs in a mixture of water and methanol solution (in 1:1 molar ratio) and the resulting mixture was allowed to react for 12 h in order to form stable thiol monolayers. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and re-dispersed in 10 mL of DI water.PEGylation of the MTG- and AET-conjugated GNRsA mixture of NHS esters, methoxy-PEG-NHS (denoted as MPEG-NHS; Mw: 5,000) and maleimide-PEG-NHS (denoted as Mal-PEG-NHS; Mw: 5,000), was reacted with the MTG- and AET-conjugated GNRs. The molar ratio of GNRs: (MPEG-NHS + Mal-PEG-NHS) was set at 1: 2,000 with the molar ratio of MPEG-NHS: Mal-PEG-NHS set at 2:3. The reaction was conducted in DI water at room temperature for 6 h after 30 min of N2 bubbling. After the reaction was complete, the solution was purified by dialysis against DI water for 2 days. The solution was then filtered through a 0.22 m membrane followed by freeze-drying.Conjugation of DOX onto the functionalized GNRsDOX was conjugated onto the GNRs via a two-step reaction. During the first step, the methoxy groups of MTG were substituted with anhydrous hydrazide by an ester-amide exchange aminolysis reaction in anhydrous DMSO at 40 oC for 24 h, with the molar ratio of GNR: hydrazide set at 1: 2,000. The resulting hydrazine-modified GNRs were purified by extensive dialysis against 0.25% ammonia solution for 48 h followed by freeze-drying. In the second step, DOX was conjugated to the hydrazide group of the GNRs through a pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage. The reaction was conducted in DMSO solution at room temperature for 24 h with a 1.5-fold excess amount of DOX to hydrazide in the dark. The unbound DOX was removed completely by dialysis against DI water in the dark.Conjugation of cRGD and NOTA onto the functionalized GNRscRGD and NOTA conjugation onto the functionalized GNRs were achieved through the reaction between the Mal groups on the surface of GNRs with the thiol groups of cRGD and/or thiol-functionalized NOTA (NOTA-SH). NOTA-SH was prepared by reacting p-SCN-Bn-NOTA with AET in the presence of TEA. The reaction was allowed to stay in DI water at room temperature for 5 h under N2 atmosphere. Thereafter, a predetermined amount of cRGD and NOTA-SH aqueous solution was added into the solution of PEGylated, DOX-conjugated GNRs suspended in water with the feed molar ratio of cRGD: NOTA: PEGylated DOX-conjugated GNRs at 400: 200: 1. The molar ratio for cRGD: NOTA was set at 2:1, with the total molar amount equaling that of Mal-PEG. This reaction was carried out in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 5 h under N2 atmosphere. After the reaction was complete, the mixture was purified by dialysis against DI water for 48 h.Determination of the DOX loading contentThe DOX loading content (DLC), defined as the weight percentage of DOX in the GNR nanocarriers, was quantified by UV-Vis analysis. First, DOX was released completely from the nanocarriers in a solution of 0.1 N HCl to cleave the hydrazone bonds. The absorbance of DOX at 485 nm was measured to determine the DLC in the solution using a previously established calibration curve. The DLC measurements were performed in triplicate for each sample.Characterization of the morphology of the GNRs and GNR nanocarriersThe UV-Vis absorption spectra of the GNR seed and GNR solutions were recorded on a Labtech 1100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Zeta potential of the GNRs was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (ZetaSizer Nano ZS90, Malvern Instrument, USA). Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM, LEO912-OMEGA, Zeiss, Germany) analysis were prepared by drying a dispersion of the GNRs on a copper grid coated with amorphous carbon.Evaluation of the pH-controlled drug release profilesThe pH-responsive DOX release behavior of the GNR nanocarriers was studied in three mediums with different pH values by UV-spectrophotometry. Briefly, 10 mg of freeze-dried cRGD/DOX-conjugated GNRs were dispersed in 5 mL of medium (10 mM phosphate buffer [pH 7.4] or acetate buffer [pH 5.3 or pH 6.6]) and placed in a dialysis bag with a Mw cut-off of 2 kDa. Subsequently, the dialysis bag was immersed in 95 mL of the same medium and kept in a horizontal laboratory shaker at 37 oC under constant shaking. At selected time intervals, 5 mL of the buffered solution outside of the dialysis bag was removed for UV analysis and replaced by fresh buffer solution of the same volume. The amount of released DOX was quantified by UV measurement at 485 nm. Each sample was measured in triplicate.Cellular uptake studyCellular uptake of the GNR nanocarriers was analyzed using flow cytometry. U87MG cells (1 105) were seeded in 24-well culture plates and cultured in DMEM overnight. The cells were then treated with free DOX, GNR-DOX-cRGD (i.e., targeted), or GNR-DOX (i.e., non-targeted) for 15 and 120 min (DOX concentration: 10 g/mL). Untreated cells served as a negative control for background fluorescence. Thereafter, the cells were lifted using CellstripperTM (Media Tech, Inc., Manassas, VA) and washed. DOX uptake was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest Pro software (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). An average of 1 104 cells was analyzed from each sample with the DOX fluorescence intensity shown on a four-decade log scale. Cellular uptake experiments were repeated three times with differences in the mean DOX fluorescence between treatment groups analyzed for significance (p 0.05) using a two-tailed Student's t-test.Cytotoxicity evaluationCytotoxicity of the GNR nanocarriers to U87MG cells was studied using the MTT assay. First, U87MG cells (5 104) were incubated in suspension for 2 h in DMEM containing free DOX, GNR-DOX-cRGD, or GNR-DOX (all with a 10 g/mL of DOX concentration) or control media. Thereafter, the cells were washed and plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and cultured for 48 h. The cells were then incubated for 4 h with DMEM containing 250 g/mL of MTT. After discarding the culture medium, 200 L of DMSO was added to dissolve the precipitates, and the resulting solution was measured for absorbance at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Significant differences in cytotoxicity between treatment groups were determined using a two-tailed Student's t-test with p 0.05 being considered significant.Animal modelAll animal studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. U87MG cells were used for tumor inoculation when they reached ~80% confluence. Four- to five-week-old female athymic nude mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and tumors were established by subcutaneously injecting 5 106 cells, suspended in 100 L of 1:1 mixture of medium and Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, NJ, USA), into the front flank of the mice 44. The tumor sizes were monitored every other day and the animals were subjected to in vivo experiments when the diameter of the tumors reached 6~8 mm (typically 4-5 weeks after inoculation).64Cu-labeling of the GNR nanocarriersBoth targeted (i.e., GNR-DOX-cRGD) and non-targeted (i.e., GNR-DOX) nanocarriers have NOTA selectively conjugated onto the distal ends of the PEG arms allowing for 64Cu-labeling. 64CuCl2 (74~185 MBq) was diluted in 300 L of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and added to a solution of GNR-DOX-cRGD or GNR-DOX (pre-centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min to remove possible aggregates) with the ratio of ~0.2 g of NOTA per 37 MBq of 64CuCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 42 C with constant shaking. GNR-DOX-64Cu and GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu were purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. The radioactive fractions containing GNR-DOX-64Cu or GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu were collected for in vivo experiments.MicroPET imagingPET scans were performed using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.). Each U87MG tumor-bearing mouse was injected with 5-10 MBq of the tracer via tail vein, and 5-15 min static PET scans were performed at various time points post-injection (p.i.). The images were reconstructed using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm with no attenuation or scatter correction 41. For each microPET scan, three-dimensional (3D) regions-of-interest (ROIs) were drawn over the tumor and major organs by using vendor software (Inveon Research Workshop; IRW) on decay-corrected whole-body images. Assuming a tissue density of 1 g/mL, the ROIs were converted to MBq/g using a conversion factor (pre-determined using a 50 mL centrifuge tube filled with ~50 MBq 64CuCl2 as a phantom) and then divided by the administered radioactivity to obtain quantitative data in the unit of percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). After the PET scans, the mice were euthanized for biodistribution studies.Biodistribution studiesEx vivo biodistribution studies were carried out to confirm that the quantitative tracer uptake values based on non-invasive microPET imaging truly represented the actual tracer distribution in tumor-bearing mice. After the last PET scans at 48 h p.i., the mice were euthanized and blood, U87MG tumors, and major organs/tissues were collected and wet-weighed. The radioactivity in the tissue was measured using a gamma-counter (Perkin Elmer) and presented as %ID/g (mean SD). A second group of mice were injected with GNR-DOX-64Cu or GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and euthanized at 5 h p.i. (when the tumor uptake was prominent) for biodistribution studies.Results and DiscussionSynthesis and characterization of the GNR nanocarriersThe GNR nanocarriers were prepared according to Scheme 1 (Figure S1). First, bare (i.e., un-functionalized) GNRs were synthesized according to the well-established seed-mediated growth method 42, 43. It was found that keeping a constant temperature at 28 oC throughout the GNR synthesis was vital for the formation of uniform GNRs. The UV/IR absorption spectrum and a TEM image of the bare GNRs are shown in Figure 2. The bare GNRs had a length and diameter of approximately 45 and 10 nm, respectively (Figure 2A), and exhibited two absorption bands: a weak short-wavelength band around 520 nm (due to the transverse electronic oscillation) and a strong long-wavelength band around 810 nm (due to the longitudinal oscillation of electrons) (Figure 2B). It is well-known that NIR light can be transmitted deep into the tissue without causing any significant damage. As such, GNRs can be potentially used for photothermal therapy. The zeta potential was determined to be 42 mV due to the existence of the cationic surfactant (i.e., CTAB) which was used for capping and stabilizing the GNRs during synthesis.In order to functionalize the GNRs, a mixture of two thiolated linkers (i.e., MTG and AET) was anchored onto the GNRs through the thiol moiety. MTG linkers were employed for DOX conjugation while the AET linkers were used to conjugate the heterofunctional NHS ester of Mal-PEG-NHS, which is used for cRGD and NOTA conjugation. MPEG-NHS was also conjugated to the AET linkers in order to adjust the solubility and stability of the resulting GNR nanocarriers in physiological conditions, as well as to help achieve the desired cRGD and NOTA molar ratios. Specifically, the molar ratio of MTG and AET was set at 1:1 in order to maximize the DOX loading level while retaining the desired solubility and stability of the GNRs.The average number of MTG and AET arms attached to a given GNR was estimated as follows: the volume of one GNR, assuming 45 nm for the length and 10 nm for the diameter (based on TEM images), is V = r2l = (5 nm)2 45 nm = 3,534.3 nm3, which means that the theoretical average mass per GNR is 6.82 10-17 g (Au=19,300 kg m-3). Hence, the Mw for 1 mole of GNRs is M = m NA 41,076,000 g mol-1 = 4.11 107 g mol-1 (NA = Avogadro constant). The increase in mass after the coupling of MTG and AET is about 0.45%, which was measured by comparing the weight of the freeze-dried GNRs before and after MTG and AET conjugation in triplicate, indicating that the molecular weight of the MTG and AET functionalized GNR rose to 41,260,007 g mol-1. As such, the average MTG and AET mass per mole of GNRs is about 184,007 g. According to the average molecular weight of the AET and MTG linkers ((77+106)/2=91.5 g mol-1) and the MTG and AET mass per mole of GNRs, the number of arms per GNR was estimated to be 184,007/91.5 = 2011 MTG and AET arms per GNR. Therefore, the number of MTG and AET anchored onto each GNR was ~1,000 each.A mixture of Mal-PEG-NHS and MPEG-NHS was coupled onto the AET linkers at the molar ratio of MPEG-NHS:Mal-PEG-NHS = 2:3 via a reaction between activated NHS esters and primary amines. For each individual GNR, a maximum of 600 arms of Mal-PEG were used to conjugate cRGD and NOTA while a maximum of 400 arms of MPEG were used to adjust the solubility/stability in physiological conditions of the GNR nanocarriers. Subsequently, DOX was conjugated through an acid-sensitive hydrazone linkage via a two-step reaction 10. Lastly, cRGD and NOTA were conjugated onto the distal ends of the MAL-PEG arms through the thiol groups. DOX conjugation on non-targeted GNR nanocarriers (i.e., GNR-DOX) was also prepared in a similar fashion to be used as a control.The amount of DOX incorporated into the GNR nanocarriers was determined by UV analysis after cleaving the hydrazone linkers between the nanocarriers and DOX. The DLC was calculated to be 0.84 wt.%. In order to test the pH-sensitivity of the GNR nanocarriers, in vitro drug release studies were performed under simulated physiological conditions at pH 5.3, 6.6, and 7.4 at 37 oC. As shown in Figure 3, the pH value of the medium had a strong effect on the DOX release rate from the GNR nanocarriers. The drug release at pH 7.4 was negligible with an initial burst release of about 6% and a total of 11% drug release after 45 h. However, at pH values of 5.3 and 6.6, the DOX release rate was much faster, with approximately 93% and 86% of the drug released within 45 h, respectively, showing that DOX release from the GNR nanocarriers in an acidic environment was governed by the acid-cleavable hydrazone linkage. As such, the pH-sensitive GNR nanocarriers will minimize premature drug release during circulation in the bloodstream (pH 7.4), yet provide a sufficient amount of drug to effectively kill the cancer cells once the GNR nanocarriers are internalized into the endocytic compartments where the pH value ranges from 4.5 to 6.5. This will greatly enhance the tumor-directed therapeutic efficacy while minimizing non-specific systemic spread of toxicity. These findings agree with our previous studies on intracellular environment-sensitive drug delivery systems 45, 46.Cellular uptake and distribution of the GNR nanocarriersIt is well-known that the inclusion of targeting ligands providing specific nanoparticle-cell surface interactions is crucial in determining the ultimate location of the nanoparticle. Integrin v3, an important biomarker overexpressed in sprouting tumor vessels and many tumor cells, plays a key role in endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis 27, 47-49. Hereby, cRGD peptide, a potent integrin v3 antagonist, was chosen as a targeting molecule for this study. To investigate the cellular uptake of the GNR nanocarriers, flow cytometry was performed using the U87MG human glioblastoma cell line which takes advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of DOX. Figure 4A shows representative quantitative flow cytometry results of the cellular uptake of the GNR-DOX-cRGD and GNR-DOX nanocarriers compared to free DOX and untreated control cells at early (15 min) and late (120 min) time points. As expected, the negative control cells without any DOX treatment showed only a low level of autofluorescence at both time points. After 15 min, U87MG cells treated with free DOX showed the highest level of fluorescence, which was 2-fold higher (p 0.005) than cells treated with GNR-DOX-cRGD (Figure 4B). At this time point, GNR-DOX nanocarriers showed the same level of fluorescence as the control cells, indicating negligible uptake of non-targeted GNRs. Overall, these results showed that conjugating cRGD to GNRs increased their cellular uptake by 2.2-fold, even at a very early time point.After 120 min of incubation, cells treated with free DOX still exhibited the highest level of fluorescence, increasing by 3.9-fold over the 15 min time point (p 0.005). Similarly, cells treated with the GNR-DOX-cRGD showed a significant 2.7-fold increase in fluorescence over the earlier time point (p 0.005). In contrast, cells treated with the GNR-DOX showed only a minimal, albeit significant (p 0.02), increase in fluorescence (by 1.3-fold) over the 15 min time point. Importantly, at this late time point the GNR-DOX-cRGD showed a 4.5-fold increase in uptake compared to the GNR-DOX, which was even greater than that observed at the 15 min time point (p 0.02). Thus, targeting V3 integrin expressed on U87MG cells is clearly an effective means of increasing the uptake of the GNR nanocarriers into these cells. Since cRGD-conjugated GNRs are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is not unexpected that their uptake was lower than that of free DOX, which readily diffuses across the cell membrane.Cytotoxicity of the GNR nanocarriersTo determine the effectiveness of the GNR nanocarriers in mediating cytotoxicity against U87MG tumor cells, cells were treated for 2 h with GNR-DOX-cRGD, GNR-DOX, or free DOX (all at 10 g/mL DOX concentration), cultured for 48 h, and analyzed using the MTT assay. Figure 5 shows that treatment of U87MG cells with GNR-DOX did not significantly reduce the viability of the cells relative to control cells. In contrast, GNR-DOX-cRGD significantly decreased the viability down to 57% of the control cells. Free DOX demonstrated the highest level of cytotoxicity (41% of control). These results are consistent with the flow cytometry data described above and demonstrate that the level of cellular uptake of the GNR nanocarriers or free DOX directly correlated with cytotoxicity. Therefore, increasing cell uptake using cRGD peptides conjugated onto the GNR nanocarriers to target V3 integrin on tumor cells can directly increase cellular destruction.MicroPET studies64Cu-labeling, including final purification using a PD-10 column, took 80 10 min (n = 10). The decay-corrected radiochemical yield was about 20-30%. For serial PET scans, the time points of 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i. were chosen based on our previous experience with other 64Cu-labeled nanomaterials 50, 51. The coronal slices that contain the U87MG tumors are shown in Figure 6. The quantitative data obtained from ROI analysis are shown in Figure 7A.Similar to other radiolabeled nanoparticles, the uptake of GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu in the liver (due to the uptake in the reticuloendothelial system (RES), hepatic clearance, and possible trans-chelation of 64Cu) was prominent at early time points and gradually declined over time. The radioactivity in the blood pool was relatively low (~2 %ID/g after 1 h p.i.), indicating that the circulation half-lives of the GNRs were quite short. The liver uptake of GNR-DOX-RGD-64Cu was 14.7 1.7, 12.7 1.3, 8.7 1.2, and 7.4 0.6 %ID/g at 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively, while the radioactivity in the blood was 1.9 0.2, 2.0 0.4, 1.8 0.2, and 2.0 0.2 %ID/g at 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively (n = 3, Figure 7A). The tumor uptake of GNR-DOX-RGD-64Cu was clearly visible even at 1 h p.i. and gradually decreased afterwards (6.4 1.2, 4.6 1.8, 3.3 0.7, and 2.2 0.3 %ID/g at 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively; n = 3; Figure 7A).For GNR-DOX-64Cu, the liver uptake was 13.5 0.8, 11.1 0.6, 7.8 0.7, and 6.6 0.7 %ID/g at 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively, and the radioactivity in the blood was 1.8 0.2, 1.8 0.1, 1.5 0.1, and 1.7 0.2 %ID/g at 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively (n = 3, Figure 7A). The tumor uptake of GNR-DOX-64Cu was 6.4 0.2, 5.3 0.2, 3.1 0.3, and 1.8 0.2 %ID/g at 1, 5, 24, and 48 h p.i., respectively (n = 3; Figure 7A). These data suggested that conjugating cRGD onto the GNR nanocarriers did not confer a significant advantage in tumor uptake in vivo over the passive targeting of GNR nanocarriers due to the EPR effect.Biodistribution studiesAfter the last PET scans at 48 h p.i., the mice were euthanized. The tissues were collected for biodistribution to further validate the in vivo PET data (Figure 7C). Separate groups of mice were injected with GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu or GNR-DOX-64Cu and euthanized at 5 h p.i. for biodistribution studies, when the tumor uptake of the radiolabeled GNR nanocarriers was prominent (Figure 7B). At 5 h p.i., the liver had the highest radioactivity uptake followed by the tumors, kidneys, and intestines. Comparing the biodistribution data at 5 h and 48 h p.i., uptake in all tissues dropped significantly, including in the tumors, which suggested that the uptake of both GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu nanocarriers was largely based on the EPR effect rather than the cRGD-integrin v3 interaction, as tracer uptake based on specific targeting tends to exhibit durable tumor retention 50, 51. Nonetheless, good tumor contrast was observed at all time points examined. The tumor/muscle ratio of GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu was 16.6 1.2 and 3.6 0.4 at 5 h and 48 h p.i., respectively (n = 3).Similar to what was observed in the PET studies, comparison of the biodistribution data of GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu at 48 h p.i. revealed a corroborating distribution pattern for GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu nanocarriers in vivo. Overall, the quantification results obtained from biodistribution studies and PET scans matched very well, confirming that quantitative ROI analysis of non-invasive microPET scans truly reflected the distribution of PET tracers in vivo.The challenges of achieving efficient in vivo tumor targeting using nanocarriers conjugated with active tumor-targeting ligands such as antibodies and peptides have been well-documented in the literature 7, 52. In this study, although in vitro experiments clearly demonstrated an increase in integrin v3-mediated uptake of GNR-DOX-cRGD over GNR-DOX in U87MG cells, there was no significant difference in the U87MG tumor uptake in vivo between GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu nanocarriers. In cell-based studies, the U87MG cells are directly incubated with GNR-DOX-cRGD and there is virtually no barrier for RGD-integrin v3 binding. However, the in vivo biodistribution of the functionalized GNRs at the tumor site is affected by many factors in vivo because of their complex interactions with the biological system. A recent study reported that while certain types of targeting peptides indeed increased the tumor accumulation of the GNRs, cRGD actually reduced the tumor accumulation of the GNRs 2-3 fold, which was attributed to a shorter circulation time and a higher uptake in the liver and spleen for the cRGD-conjugated GNRs 53. The type of targeting ligands also affected the nanoparticle distribution in tumor cells and tumor microenvironment 53. In addition, our previous studies on cRGD-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocarriers and cRGD-conjugated unimolecular micelles had clearly shown that cRGD-conjugated nanoparticles had a much higher tumor accumulation than their corresponding non-targeted nanoparticles 45, 46. As such, both the type of the nanoparticles and the type of targeting peptides can affect the in vivo tumor accumulation of these nanoparticles.ConclusionsMultifunctional water-soluble GNR nanocarriers were developed to provide both tumor-targeted drug delivery and PET imaging. These GNR nanocarriers exhibit pH-sensitive drug release behaviour, which can minimize non-specific systemic spread of toxic drugs during circulation while maximizing the efficiency of tumor-targeted anticancer drug delivery. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that the cRGD-conjugated GNR nanocarriers showed a higher cellular uptake and thus a more potent cytotoxicity in cancer cells overexpressing V3 integrin when compared to the cRGD-free GNR nanocarriers. Although the cRGD-conjugated GNR nanocarriers did not show any significant increases in tumor accumulation according to both the in vivo PET imaging and biodistribution studies, this study does provide a novel nanoplatform for possible integration of multi-functionality including molecular targeting, chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, as well as multimodality imaging such as PET/optical, which can potentially lead to improved therapeutic efficacy and cancer monitoring. Future work may focus on a further understanding of the optimal conditions for combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy, as well as dual-modality PET and optical imaging utilizing these multifunctional GNR nanocarriers.This work is supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (CMMI 1032186), the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Intercampus grant, the Department of Defense (W81XWH-11-1-0644 and W81XWH-11-1-0648), and the NIH through the UW Radiological Sciences Training Program 5 T32 CA009206-32.

Tuning the size and aspect ratio of AuNR tailors the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the NIR spectrum at which biological tissues are transparent, thus enables specific and effective treatment. The AuNR extravasates into tumor interstitium through enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Efficient AuNR based cancer therapy requires efficient AuNR tumor delivery. However, the size of AuNR can dramatically affect its blood circulation and tumor accumulation. Here we proposed for the first time a systematic framework to investigate the size-dependent kinetics of AuNRs during EPR mediated tumor delivery. By using 64Cu-labeled AuNRs with positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling, the in vivo uptake and kinetics of 64Cu-AuNR during its blood circulation, tumor accumulation and elimination were studied both in vitro and in vivo. The results of different sized AuNRs were compared and the optimum size of AuNR was suggested for EPR mediated tumor delivery. Our study provides a better understanding of the in vivo behavior of AuNR, which can help future design of nanomaterials for cancer imaging and therapy.gold nanorodsenhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effectpositron emission tomography (PET)kinetic modelingIntroductionUsing nano-sized particles as the nanocarrier to load drug molecules has become an important strategy in intravascular drug delivery 1, 2. A variety of nano-sized diagnostic and therapeutic agents have been developed for clinical applications 3-5. Unlike the small molecular chemotherapeutic drugs, nanoparticles based drugs cannot get into healthy tissues due to the smaller junctions of the endothelial lining but permeate into the tumor tissue via the leaky endothelium, and stay within the diseased tissue due to the compromised lymphatic drainage of the tumor. This phenomenon is known as enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) 6, and has been considered as the fundamental for nanomedicine drug delivery in solid tumor. However, the nanoparticles can be recognized and eliminated by liver and macrophage phagocytic system (MPS) 7, 8 during blood circulation or excretion by renal system for those smaller than 5 nm 9. Efficient tumor delivery through EPR effect requires nanoparticles to evade the MPS elimination and circulate in blood for sufficient time a priori. The enhanced angiogenesis and the lack of functional intratumoral lymphatic vessels in solid tumor thus reduced clearance of leaked particles 10 will also favor the tumor accumulation of nanoparticles through EPR. The criteria of designing nanoparticle for efficient delivery in solid tumor therefore include prolonged circulation half-life, enhanced EPR effect for high tumor accumulation and low uptake by liver and MPS 7, 10.Among various nanoplatforms investigated, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively used in a wide range of biomedical applications due to their unique surface, optical and electrical properties 11, 12. Researches have been prompted to study how different properties of gold nanoparticles have affected their interaction with the biological environment and eventually their homing to tumor. Studies have been focusing on the surface coating of the gold nanoparticles, which can be modified to achieve optimized targeting 13-16. The surface coating with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) prevented protein serum binding and plasma clearance by macrophages 17, thus prolonged blood circulation of AuNPs therefore increased drug concentration in tumor by 10- to 100-fold compared with the use of non-PEGylated free drug 18. Besides surface coating, the size and shape also dramatically affect the circulation, biodistribution and tumor accumulation of the gold nanoparticles. Several studies have been reported to address this issue 17, 19-21; however, the majority of size-dependent studies were focusing on spherical AuNPs.Rod shaped gold nanoparticles have attracted increasing scientific attention for their unique optical and photothermal properties and promising applications in the field of cancer imaging, drug delivery and cancer therapy 22-24. Because of the anisotropic shape, gold nanorods (AuNRs) can be characterized by two localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) bands 24: the transvers band located in the visible spectrum at 520 nm; the longitudinal band which varies with the aspect ratio of the AuNR 25, 26. Tuning the size and aspect ratio of the AuNRs allows to tailor the LSPR in the NIR range at which biological tissues are relatively optically transparent 27, in particular for photothermal and photodynamic therapy, thus specific and effective treatment may be possible. The effect of the size of AuNR on its plasmon resonance and the photothermal therapeutic efficacy has been studied in vitro 28. However, therapy efficacy requires efficient intravascular delivery and tumor extravasation of AuNR, it is extremely important to understand the effect of size and aspect ratio of the AuNRs on its kinetics and tissue uptake during intravascular circulation, MPS elimination and tumor accumulation.The effect of the aspect ratio on nanorod biodistribution and tumor homing has been studied with nucleoprotein based nanorods in vivo with fluorescence imaging. Meanwhile the kinetics of blood circulation and tumor accumulation has been investigated with theoretical simulation and in vitro with copper oxide nanorod conducted under ideal experimental conditions 29, 30. However, the rigid soft-matter nucleoprotein nanorod and copper oxide nanorod would behave very differently from AuNRs, thus their results may not be extrapolated directly to the case of AuNRs; The size effect of AuNR on the in vivo kinetics yet remains unclear. Developing a quantitative framework to investigate the size effect on the EPR mediated tumor delivery kinetics is crucial to guide the design of AuNR based drug delivery system and its application in anti-cancer therapy. Due to the small size and complex interaction with biological environment, it is very challenging to visualize and quantify the AuNR intravenously injected into biological system in vivo. The fluorescently labeled nanoparticles enable the accessibility of imaging the biodistribution and kinetics of the nanoparticles in vivo 17, however, the poor tissue penetration and the lack of accuracy for three-dimensional image quantification offered by in vivo optical imaging can restrain its application in nanomedicine. The development of radiolabeled nanoparticles provides a high sensitivity, high spatial, and high temporal resolution imaging technique for better quantifying nanoparticles in vivo 31, 32.In the present study, by using positron emission tomography (PET) with 64Cu-labeled PEGylated AuNR, we have provided for the first time in vivo systematic frame work to investigate the size dependent kinetics of AuNRs during their tumor delivery. In analyzing the time-dependent in vivo uptake of different sizes of AuNR in major organs with kinetic modeling, we were able to interpret how the size of AuNR could affect the in vivo kinetics during blood circulation, MPS elimination and tumor accumulation, and eventually suggest the optimal size of AuNR for potentially more efficient EPR mediated tumor delivery.Results and DiscussionAuNR of five different sizes (Table 1) were used in the present study. The volume of the AuNR (Vrod) measured from TEM image (Figure 1A) was in the order of: P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 and the aspect ratio was in the order of P5 P3 P2 P1 P4. The UV absorption spectra of the five AuNRs were characterized and shown in Figure 1B. The theoretical diffusion parameter Mdiff given by Eq. 2 was calculated for each sized AuNR (Table 2). Mdiff was in power regression with the Vrod (Figure S1D), indicating that smaller AuNR reveal higher diffusiveness. The theoretical margination (Mmarg) of the nanorods was inversely proportional to the nanorod volume (Eq. 4). Therefore, smaller AuNR is expected to have higher margination capacity. However, these relations were restrained to theoretical assumption based on in vitro studies under ideal conditions 29, 33. The cytotoxicity study (Figure S2) showed that all the AuNRs were safe for in vivo use. Ex vivo biodistribution study (Figure S3) at 48 h post injection was used to evaluate the in vivo uptake measured in PET. Positive correlation was found between the in vivo PET uptake and ex vivo biodistribution result (r 0.6, p 0.001).Kinetics model for EPR mediate AuNR tumor deliveryThe time activity curves (TAC) of heart, tumor, liver, and spleen (Figure 3, Figure S5-S8) were generated from the reconstructed sequential PET images (Figure S4). In order to accurately quantify the in vivo kinetics of AuNR during the blood circulation, the MPS elimination and tumor accumulation through EPR effect based on the in vivo PET data, the first step is to define an appropriate kinetic model. Wong et al. has suggested a three-compartment model to assess the EPR effect on tumor uptake of small molecule drug doxorubicin and the nano-sized liposome loaded drug Doxil 34. This model consisted of a central compartment for blood pool and two peripheral compartments in separating the uptake kinetics in normal tissue and in tumor, since small molecules could extravasate not only through tumor leaky vasculature but also 'diffuse' through the vessel endothelium of normal tissue. However, in our case it was not necessary to separate two compartments for normal and tumor tissue, as AuNR was considered to be impermeable in normal tissue. Stapleton et al. has also proposed a model of EPR effect of liposome transport in solid tumor 35. This model only distinguished two components: blood and tumor. Therefore, in our study, a conventional reversible two-compartment model was used (Figure 2) to assess the kinetics of EPR mediated tumor delivery, with one central compartment representing the 64Cu-AuNR concentrations in the blood, and the other peripheral compartment for concentration in tumor extravascular space.Size-dependent blood circulation and MPS elimination of 64Cu-AuNRAs mentioned previously, the prior condition for efficient EPR mediated tumor delivery is sufficiently long blood circulation in evading the MPS elimination. The blood circulation is generally characterized by blood uptake over time and the blood elimination half-life (T1/2). In comparing the mean blood TAC of each size of AuNR (Figure 3A), the smallest AuNR P1 showed the highest mean blood retention over the entire 48 h period (U test p 0.05 from 3 h to 48 h post injection); the P4 and P5 which were the two largest in volume had the lowest mean blood retention, blood retention of the median size P2 and P3 located in between. At each time point, there was a negative dependence between the blood uptake and AuNR volume (r negative, |r| 0.5, p 0.05). The T1/2 of each AuNR (Table 2) was calculated by fitting the blood TAC with equation Eq. 6. A strong linear correlation was found between the T1/2 and the Vrod (Figure 4A, r = -0.919, p 0.001), indicating that AuNR of smaller volume preferably circulate in blood for longer time. This may be due to the higher diffusiveness of smaller AuNR (Mdiff in power regression with Vrod, Figure S1D). Previous studies also showed that smaller AuNP revealed longer blood circulation than the larger ones regardless of whether the AuNPs were PEGylated 36, 37 or not 38. Besides, Discher et al. also mentioned that high aspect ratio nanoparticles tend to align themselves to the flow streamline and avoid engulfment by macrophages thus remain in blood circulation for a long period of time 39. In our study, the smallest P1 also exhibited high aspect ratio, which could further give favor to its long circulation in the blood. However, no correlation was found between the aspect ratio of AuNR with the T1/2 or the blood uptake of each time point, e.g. the P4 has the highest aspect ratio but not the longest T1/2. This indicated that blood circulation of AuNR was dominantly affected by its volume rather than the aspect ratio. We can thus conclude that smaller AuNR with high aspect ratio is preferred if we need AuNR to have longer T1/2 for longer blood circulation.During the blood circulation, a part of AuNRs are uptaken by the MPS as a response of the immune system 40. At early time, P1 and P3 revealed relatively less accumulation in the liver (Figure 3C), which was presumably due to their relatively high blood uptake (Figure 3A) especially at early time points. For spleen TAC (shown in Figure 3D), the time to reach maximum spleen uptake was not significantly different among different sizes of AuNR. Over the 48 h post injection period, the largest AuNR P5 exhibited the highest uptake both in liver and spleen (Figure 3C, 3D), while P1 showed the lowest in the liver. This corroborates with previous in vivo studies that larger AuNP were cleared faster than the smaller ones from blood by MPS 17, 19, 21. However, there was no significant correlation between in vivo liver and spleen uptake with all five sizes of AuNR, indicating that the MPS elimination of AuNR is statistically independent of the size of AuNR, at least for the AuNR sizes involved in this study.However, the decrease in mean liver and spleen uptake from 24 h to 48 h p.i. (Figure 3C, 3D) was more significant in P1 (ca. 35% for liver, 25% for spleen, p 0.05) than the larger ones (ca. 15-20 % for liver, 5% for spleen), revealing that the excretion of P1 (the smallest) from MPS was faster than the larger sized AuNRs. This fast clearance from MPS has also been reported previously and has been considered as an advantage for small sized AuNP for reducing toxicity to biological systems 36, 37. Interestingly, we also observed that not only small AuNR but also AuNR of high aspect ratio (example of P4 with highest aspect ratio), despite of its large volume, was still capable of evading the MPS elimination (Figure 3B-C) and staying in blood circulation for improved tumor uptake 19.Size dependent EPR mediated tumor delivery of 64Cu-AuNRWhen AuNR reach tumor site through blood circulation, it first needs to marginate towards the vessel wall in order to translocate to tumor extravascular space through vascular leakage. The transportation kinetics from blood to tumor and vice versa were represented by the kinetics rate constant K1 and k2, respectively. According to theoretical equations (Eq. 3 and 4) derived from in vitro experiment 33, smaller AuNR is expected to have stronger margination due to faster Brownian motion and higher diffusiveness 19, consequently smaller AuNRs are supposed to have higher trans-endothelium kinetics. Previous studies also suggested that the margination of nanorod increased with higher aspect ratio 19, 41. However, a contradictory result has been observed in our in vivo study. The trans-endothelium kinetics K1 was positively correlated (Figure 4E, r = 0.745, p 0.001) with the Vrod, indicating that larger AuNR extravasated faster from tumor vasculature. The correlation between the Vrod and the reverse kinetics (leakage of AuNR from tumor back to blood) k2 was also moderately positive (r=0.47, p0.05). However, there was no significant correlation (Figure 4F, r = 0.35, p 0.05) between the Vrod and the volume of distribution VD at equilibrium, where VD is given by K1/k2. The VD takes account both the inbound and outbound kinetics of AuNR trans-endothelium movement and can describe the net influx rate of AuNR tumor delivery at equilibrium as a result of the EPR effect. Therefore, it is more accurate to use VD for evaluating the AuNR kinetics rate related to the EPR effect. The independence between Vrod and VD indicated that for the AuNR size involved in our study, although larger sized AuNR potentially exhibited higher unidirectional kinetics from blood to tumor, net trans-endothelium kinetics rate through EPR effect was insensitive to the variation of the AuNR size. Moreover, no significant correlation was found between kinetics rates and the aspect ratio of AuNR. These discrepancies between our findings and previous in vitro studies might be due to the fact that in vitro studies were carried out under ideal red blood cell free system 19, whereas it did not take into account the complex interaction of AuNR with other components present in blood. Furthermore, the trans-endothelium movement of AuNRs through EPR effect involves not only the margination of the AuNRs, but also their chance to be released through the vasculature leakage.After getting into the tumor extravascular space, we have characterized the retention of the AuNR in the tumor by using the AuNR's total tumor residence time (tumor AUC) and tumor uptake at later time points (24 h and 48 h). The P1 and P4 have shown higher tumor uptake over the 48 h p.i. compared to the other sizes of AuNR (Figure 3B). The tumor AUC was strongly correlated with the tumor maximum uptake (Figure S1A, r = 0.96, p 0.001), with the tumor uptake at 24 h p.i. (Figure S1B, r = 0.95, p 0.001) and at 48 h p.i. (Figure S1C, r = 0.85, p 0.001), therefore any size-dependent correlation related to tumor AUC would also be considered to be related to tumor maximum uptake and tumor uptake at 24 h and 48 h. Moderate correlations were found between aspect ratio of AuNR with tumor AUC (Figure 4B, r = 0.546, p 0.05) thus with the tumor uptake at 24 h p.i. (Figure 4C, r = 0.46, p 0.05) and 48 h p.i. (Figure 4D, r = 0.604, p 0.05) as well. However, there was no correlation between these tumor retention parameters and the Vrod. The correlation with the aspect ratio of AuNR may be explained by the study by Arnida et al. 42, in which they compared the in vivo tumor accumulation of spherical AuNP and AuNR. They found that AuNR exhibited much higher tumor uptake than spherical AuNP. The anisotropic structure of AuNR appears to be advantageous over the isotropic AuNP counterpart in tumor accumulation 42. Considering the isotropic AuNP as an exceptional case of anisotropic nanoparticle with extremely low aspect ratio, then the anisotropic AuNR of higher aspect ratio is suggested to have higher tumor accumulation than the AuNR of lower aspect ratio.A major concern is the high inter-subject variation of tumor uptake observed for all size of AuNR at different time points. When comparing the TAC of each individual mouse within each size of AuNR (Figure S5), high inter-subject variation of tumor uptake over time was observed especially at early time points before 24 h p.i. Consequently, it resulted in high standard deviation for the mean TAC of each size (Figure 3B), therefore the differences in tumor uptake between different sizes of AuNR seemed to be less significant. We further used Mann-Whitney U test 43 to compare and evaluate the differences in the mean tumor uptake of AuNR with different sizes at each time point. The results of U test (Table S1) showed that the difference in tumor uptake was generally not significant among different sizes of AuNR, except at certain time points (marked in red in Table S1 when p 0.05).The high inter-subject variation may have also contributed to the weak or none correlation observed between the size of AuNR and its tumor retention and trans-endothelium kinetics. Previously Stapleton et al. defined their EPR model in considering the vascular permeability and the interstitial fluid pressure (which was also related to the vascular permeability) 35. We then questioned whether the inter-subject variation on tumor uptake could be related to the intrinsic microenvironment of tumor vasculature. A separate group of U87MG tumor-bearing mice (n = 4) were thus used to compare the in vivo PET tumor uptake with the ex vivo tumor vascular density (CD31 staining, Figure 5A-B) and tumor vascular permeability (EB count, Figure 5C). 64Cu-AuNRs of two different sizes (P3, P4) were randomly selected and injected into mice. CD31 staining and EB extraction were performed after PET scanning at 24 h p.i. to evaluate the tumor vascular density and vascular permeability. In comparing the in vivo PET tumor uptake (Figure 5D) of the four mice with the ex vivo results of CD31 (Figure 5A-B) and EB staining (Figure 5C), a strong correlation was found between the in vivo tumor uptake and the CD31 staining count (Figure 5E, r = 0.976, p 0.05). However, there was no correlation between the in vivo tumor uptake and EB staining. This result indicated that high (low) in vivo tumor uptake could be a result of abundant (insufficient) tumor vasculature, while the vascular permeability, for one single type of tumor, was rather independent of the in vivo tumor uptake of AuNR. This is possibly due to the fact that for the five sizes of AuNR used in our study, the size of vascular leakage is much larger 44 than the size of AuNR, thus the possibility of different sized AuNR being able to escape through the leaky vasculature is virtually the same. With relatively similar possibility of extravasation through EPR for different sized AuNR, the differences in tumor uptake would be related to the degree of vascularization present in each particular tumor. It would be necessary to have larger difference in size of AuNR to observe more significant difference in size related tumor uptake.Overall, our study has manifested the interplay of the particle volume with the aspect ratio of AuNR in affecting its blood circulation, elimination and EPR mediated tumor delivery. Smaller volume slows its MPS elimination from the blood, resulting a longer circulation time, while higher aspect ratio potentially provides higher retention in the tumor. Therefore, AuNR of smaller size and higher aspect ratio would be the best option potentially for more efficient EPR mediated tumor delivery. The experimental framework we provided has illustrated the complexity of how the size of AuNR could affect its tumor delivery and how we could better understand this process to find the optimum candidate with the help of in vivo imaging technique. The discrepancies between previous in vitro study and our in vivo findings further brought up the importance and necessity of in vivo study, to truly understand the mechanism present in biological system. Investigating the size-dependent kinetics of AuNR in other types of tumor models will be necessary to further validate our findings. A full understanding of size-dependent kinetics of AuNR during EPR mediated tumor delivery will also push forward the translation into clinical application of AuNR and other nanomaterials in cancer imaging and therapy.ConclusionWe have provided a systematic investigation on the effect of AuNR size on their EPR mediated tumor delivery kinetics both in vitro and in vivo. PET with 64Cu labeled PEGlylated AuNR allowed us to quantify AuNR distribution in major organs (heart, tumor, liver and spleen) over time. Compartmental modeling was used to analyze the kinetics of AuNR during their intravascular circulation and tumor accumulation through EPR effect. Based on our study, the elimination half-life was negatively correlated with the volume of AuNR, while the net trans-endothelium kinetics was independent of the size of AuNR. Despite the relatively high inter-subject variation in tumor uptake, the tumor retention of AuNR was related to the aspect ratio of AuNR. Besides, smaller AuNRs were cleared faster from liver and spleen over time. Consequently, we would suggest AuNRs with relatively small volume and high aspect ratio to be the ideal candidate for EPR mediated tumor delivery. The findings of our study offer tools for the design of more efficient AuNR based drug delivery platforms and potentially supporting their translation into clinical applications.Materials and methodsCell lines and animal modelsAll experiments with live animals were conducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Animal Care and Use Committee (NIH CC/ACUC). The U87MG cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured and passaged in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 C and 5% CO2. Athymic nude mice were obtained from Harlan laboratories (Frederick, MD, USA). The U87MG tumor model was generated by subcutaneous injection of 5106 cells in 100 L of PBS into the right shoulder of nude mice. The mice were used for imaging when the tumor volume reached around 100 mm3 (10-15 days after inoculation).Synthesis of Cu-64 labeled gold nanorodsMaterialsGold chloride trihydrate (49%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide (98%) (CTAB), benzyldimethylammoniumchloride hydrate (98%) (BDAC), sodium borohydride (99%), silver nitrate, L-ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the solutions were prepared by deionized water (18 M). The HS-PEG-NH2 (Mw = 5000) was purchased from Nanocs. Radiometal [64Cu] was produced by the PET department, NIH clinical center.Synthesis of gold nanorodsThe synthesis of gold nanorods (AuNR) followed a reported seed-mediated growth method 45. Briefly, Au seeds were prepared by adding ice-cold NaBH4 (0.6 mL, 0.01 M NaBH4) to a mixture of CTAB solution (5 mL, 0.20 M) and HAuCl4 (5 mL, 0.0005 M). After vigorous stirring the solution for 2 min, the solution was kept at 25 C for 2 h to make sure the NaBH4 was consumed. To synthesize AuNR, CTAB (5 mL, 0.2 M) was first mixed with AgNO3 solution (4 mM). Then HAuCl4 (5 mL, 1 mM), ascorbic acid (70 L, 0.0788 M), and 12 L of gold seed solution were added sequentially. The reaction was performed at 27-30 C for at least 1 h. The aspect ratio of AuNR was adjusted by tuning the volume of AgNO3 (from 0.05 to 0.25 mL) and using BDAC as co-surfactant.Surface modification of AuNRThe as-synthesized AuNRs were purified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and re-dispersed in deionized water. 1 mg NRs were mixed and shaken with 3 mg SH-PEG-NH2 in 5 mL DI water for 2 h at 27 C. The replaced ligands and unbound polymers were then purified via dialysis bag with MW 10 K.CharacterizationTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a FEI Tecnai 12 (120 KV) microscope. The samples were prepared by depositing a drop of AuNR dispersion on carbon-coated copper grids and dried overnight. UV spectra was obtained by a Genesys 10S UV-vis Spectrophotometer.Preparation of 64Cu-labeled AuNR15 L 64CuCl2 was pre-mixed with 5.5 mg of sodium ascorbate (in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 8.6) and vortexed. Then 200 mL of AuNR (1 mg/mL) were added and the solution was shaken at 37 C for 1 h. The resulting 64Cu-labeled AuNRs were purified by centrifugation (4000 g, 10 min) for three times and re-dispersed in PBS. The labeling efficiency was determined by using instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) plates with citric acid (0.1 M pH 5) as an eluent. The labeling efficiency was nearly 100% for all five samples.Cytotoxicity studyCytotoxic study of AuNRs with five different sizes was conducted using U87MG human glioblastoma cells. The cells were cultured in MEM and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1104 cells per well. After 24 h incubation, different concentrations of AuNR were add into each well and incubated at 37 C. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed twice with room temperature PBS then 5 L of MTT solution (10 mg/mL MTT in PBS, pH 7.4) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for another 3 h. Then the medium was removed and 100 L DMSO was added into each well to dissolve the intracellular formazan crystal. The absorbance was recorded by a plate reader at 490 nm, and the cell viability was calculated by comparing cells with the untreated wells as control.Theoretical calculation of AuNR diffusion and marginationCheong et al. have suggested the theoretical model of diffusion of nanorods, where nanorod was under translational and rotational Brownian motion 29, 41. The Brownian movement was a result of random and complex interactions of nanoparticles with other components present in the flouting medium, and was considered to be related to the size and shape of the particle. The endpoint Brownian diffusion coefficient of nanorod in a pure diffusive liquid medium (e.g. pure water) was expressed as (Eq. 1): and (eq.1)Where and are the diffusion coefficients measured along and normal to the axis of nanorod, respectively. The L and r are the length and diameter of nanorods, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, is the viscosity of the fluid. The constant 0.45, depending on the detailed shape of the cylindrical rod. For a given diffusive medium, is considered as a constant, therefore the above diffusion coefficient and for a given size can be simplified and expressed as a function of and , respectively. In the present study, the average and were calculated for each sized AuNR and represented the diffusion parameter (noted as Mdiff).Mdiff = average (, ) (eq.2)MarginationBesides traveling through the blood circulation, nanorods marginate towards the vessel wall so as to escape from the blood circulation through trans-endothelium movement. For nanoparticle size 500 nm, the margination of nanorod towards flow chamber wall is a result of Brownian motion 19. Based on the equations of Brownian motion 41, the Brownian force exerted on nanoparticle is expressed as 33:(eq.3)Where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and is the equivalent spherical diameter of the particle. Therefore, in our study, the margination of AuNR was theoretically supposed to be inversely proportional to the volume of AuNR (Vrod).(eq.4)In vivo PET imagingIn vivo static PET imaging was performed using an Inveon PET scanner (Siemens, USA). Approximately 3.8 MBq of 64Cu labeled AuNR of each size was injected intravenously to tumor-bearing mice. Five mice were used for each size of AuNR. Sequential PET scans were performed at 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h post-injection. The acquisition time was 10 min for the scans before 24 h post-injection and 15 min for the scan at 48 h post injection. The mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane (1% in 1 L/min oxygen) during each scan. PET images were reconstructed using 3D ordered-subsets expectation maximum followed by maximum a posteriori algorithm with a smoothing parameter of 0.1 (OSEM-3D-MAP).Region of interest (ROI) and time-activity curves (TAC)The region of interest (ROI) of heart, tumor, liver and spleen were drawn on the reconstructed PET images using Inveon Research Workplace (IRW) 3.0 software (Siemens Preclinical Solution). The tumor ROI was defined in applying a threshold to eliminate tumor necrotic region. The mean radioactivity of 64Cu-AuNR in each ROI was calculated with decay correction. The time activity curves (TAC) were generated by plotting the 64Cu-AuNR uptake as a function of time. The unit of the time axis was in hour. The TAC of the heart (Figure S5), tumor (Figure S6), liver (Figure S7) and spleen (Figure S8) ROIs were generated from the reconstructed PET images for each individual mouse used for each size of AuNR (Figure S3). Then for each ROI, the individual TACs within each group of AuNR size were averaged to have the mean TAC (expressed in meanSD) for each size of AuNR (Figure 3).Kinetics of blood circulation and EPR mediated tumor deliveryThe effect of AuNR size on its blood circulation and tumor accumulation kinetics was studied in vivo based on the blood and tumor TACs generated from the sequential static PET. The blood TAC was defined using the maximum uptake (in %ID/g) of the heart ROI and was used as the plasma input function, while the tumor TAC was defined using the mean tumor uptake (in %ID/g) within the tumor ROI. The blood elimination rate was calculated by fitting the blood TAC with a bi-exponential function:(eq.5)the blood elimination half-life (T1/2) equals to(eq.6)The transportation kinetics of 64Cu-AuNR from tumor vessel to tumor extravascular space through EPR effect (Figure 2A) was assessed by a two-compartment model 34, 46 (Figure 2B). The concentration change between the compartments was expressed as(eq.7)Where Cp(t) and Cd(t) are the 64Cu-AuNR activity concentrations (Bq/mL) as a function of time in the compartments corresponding to plasma and tumor interstitium, and the K1 and k2 are the transportation rates of 64Cu-AuNR from vessel to tumor and vice versa. Cp(t) is given by the blood TAC measured from heart ROI and the Cd(t) is calculated by solving the above differential equations (Eq. 7). The signal intensity measured in a given tumor ROI on PET images is a weighted sum of Cp(t) and Cd(t) expressed as:(eq.8)Where is the fractional blood volume in tumor, wd is the relative volume ratio for the rest of tumor area (wd =1-). Given the measured TAC of tumor ROI and blood input function, the K1, k2 values were calculated by fitting the measured TAC with the analytical ROI function CROI(t) (Eq. 8) using non-linear least-square regression. The goodness of the fitting was evaluated using the residual analysis 47, and the error (between the data value and estimated function value) was limited to be less than 5%. The volume of distribution in tumor interstitial space VD at equilibrium was defined as:(eq.9)The total residence time of 64Cu-AuNR in tumor during the 48 h post injection was also studied by calculating area under the curve (AUC) of the tumor TAC.(eq.10)The compartmental modeling was conducted using a home-made Matlab object-oriented toolbox. Input parameters include plasma input TAC data, tumor ROI TAC data, and initial guess of K1, k2, wp, and wd values. According to preliminary fitting test, the K1 and k2 were initialized to 0.01; wp and wd were initialized to 0.1.BiodistributionMice were sacrificed at 48 h after intravenous administration of 64Cu-labeled AuNR (after PET imaging at 48 h). Tumors and major organs including heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, stomach, intestine, bone, muscle and blood were collected and wet weighed, 64Cu present in each organ was measured with a gamma counter and expressed in %ID/g.CD31 immunostainingImmunostaining against endothelial cell marker CD31 was performed to evaluate the tumor vascular density. After in vivo PET scan at 24 h post injection of 64Cu-AuNR, tumors from a separate group of mice were harvested and immersed in O.C.T. Compound. After freezing in a -80 C freezer, 10 m thick slides were acquired by Cryostat. Firstly, the slices were fixed with z-fix for 20 min and then washed with PBS twice for 5 min. Secondly, the slices were blocked with 1% BSA (in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody (Rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody, 1:150 in 1% BSA) for 2 h. After being washed with PBS, the slices were incubated with secondary antibody (Cy3-donkey anti-rat IgG, 1:100 in 1% BSA) in darkroom for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the slices were mounted with DAPI mounting medium and ready for microscopic observation.Evans blue extractionEvans blue extraction technique was used to evaluate tumor vascular permeability. After PET imaging at 24 h time point, Evans blue (30 mg/kg body weight) was intravenously injected into mice. At 2 h after dye injection the mice were sacrificed, a thorough whole body blood flush was carried out. Then the tumors were weighed and cut into small pieces of 50-100 mg. Formamide was added into each tumor containing tube for Evans blue extraction. Seventy-two hours later, the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min, the concentration of Evans blue in the supernatant was then measured.Statistical analysisThe in vivo uptake measured by PET was expressed in %ID/g; the kinetics parameters K1 and k2 were expressed in h-1. All quantitative values in the study were presented in mean STD. Mann-Whitney U test 43 was used to compare and evaluate the significance in differences between two independent samples. In our study, it was used to compare the different tissue uptake of different sized AuNR at different time points. The p value of U test less than 0.05 was considered to be significantly different. The dependences and correlations between different groups of values were evaluated with Pearson correlation. The correlation coefficient r was calculated, where r =1 referred to total positive dependence and r = -1 referred to total negative dependence, and r = 0 meant no correlation between the two groups of values. P value less than 0.05 indicated that the correlation was statistically significant.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary tables and figures.Click here for additional data

The influence of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on the distribution and toxicity of the NGO was also investigated. The results show that NGO is mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen. Retention in the lung is partially due to NGO aggregation. The PEG coating reduces the retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen and promotes the clearance of NGO from these organs, but NGO and NGO-PEG are still present after 3 months. The PEG coating effectively reduces the early weight loss caused by NGO and alleviates NGO-induced acute tissue injuries, which can include damage to the liver, lung, and kidney, and chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis.Keywordsgraphene oxidebiodistributiontoxicitypolyethylene glycolIntroductionNanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) consists of oxidized graphene sheets with abundant functional groups on their surface that make NGO soluble in water and provide opportunities for chemical modification.15 As a nascent nanomaterial, NGO exhibits unique size, shape, and physicochemical properties that make it a promising biomaterial for biomedical applications.610 Recently, NGO has been demonstrated to be an effective nanocarrier of anticancer drugs.1114 However, the in vivo distribution and toxicity of NGO, which would provide important supporting information to help determine its feasibility for potential biomedical applications, have rarely been evaluated.Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a commonly used biocompatible polymer that has been used to increase the solubility, reduce the accumulation in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), and prolong the blood half-life of various nanoparticles and nanoparticle complexes.1520 PEG is fixed on nanoparticle surfaces by adsorption or covalent binding. When functionalized with PEG, nanoparticles can avoid serum protein binding and achieve enhanced permeability and retention in tumor model systems.21,22 It has been reported that PEGylated NGO with a size range of 1050 nm exhibits highly efficient passive tumor targeting with relatively low retention in the MPS and no obvious side effects.23 However, a comparative study of the distribution and toxicity of NGO with or without PEG coating has not been reported until now, especially for larger-size graphene oxide.In this study, the in vivo behavior of NGO in mice after intravenous injection was investigated using 125I radioisotope tracing. In addition, the toxicology of NGO was determined using an evaluation system that includes the assessment of body weight, a blood biochemistry analysis, and a histopathological examination. We particularly focused on the influence of the PEG coating on the distribution and toxicity of NGO.Materials and methodsMaterialsCarrier-free Na125I was purchased from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA, USA), chloramine-T was sourced from Merck Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China), and the other chemicals were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China). The synthesis and characterization of NGO and 125I-NGO was performed as previously described.24 NGO was synthesized from natural graphite by oxidation with H2SO4/KMnO4 according to a modified Hummers method. The NGO was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Avatar 370; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), Raman spectroscopy (LabRam-1B; JY Co., Ltd., Dilor, France), scanning electron microscopy (1530VP; LEO Corporation, Oberkochen, Germany), transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 2010; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope III; Veeco Metrology Group, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). 125I-NGO was synthesized according to the chloramine-T (N-chloro-p-toluenesulfonic acid) method. The radiochemical purity and stability of 125I-NGO was then examined.PEG coatingNormal saline (0.9%) was added to the NGO or 125I-NGO suspension at a 1:1 ratio. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes, decanted, and resuspended in 2 mg/mL PEG6000 (linear, without any functional group at its end) solution. After incubation under ultrasonication for 30 minutes at room temperature, 0.9% normal saline was added again, and the mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes, decanted, and resuspended in Milli-Q water. After ultrasonication for 30 minutes at room temperature, the same procedure was repeated three times to remove excess PEG reagent. The resultant PEG-modified NGO was designated as NGO-PEG or 125I-NGO-PEG, respectively. Meanwhile, NGO and 125I-NGO suspension without PEG coatings were also prepared by the same method, except that Milli-Q water was substituted for PEG6000 solution. Thermal gravimetric analysis of NGO and NGO-PEG was performed to determine the amount of PEG coating layer on the surface of the NGO using a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TG 209 F3 Tarsus; Netzsch, Selb, Germany). The temperature of the sample was gradually increased from 40C to 700C at a rate of 10C per minute. In addition, the size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of NGO and NGO-PEG in Milli-Q water were measured by dynamic light scattering with a DelsaNano C particle analyzer (A53878; Beckman Coulter Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA).AnimalsAll animal experiments were performed in compliance with the national guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Number 2011-0016). Male Kunming mice (2832 g) were obtained from the Shanghai Slack Experimental Animal Center. The animal room was maintained at 22C with a daily light-dark cycle (with light from 6 am to 6 pm). The mice were fed standard mouse chow and provided water ad libitum. All of the procedures using animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Distribution of 125I-NGO, 125I-NGO-PEG, and Na125IEighty mice were randomly assigned to 16 groups (five mice per group). Each mouse was intravenously injected with 100 L of 125I-NGO, 125I-NGO-PEG, or Na125I through a tail vein. The mice were sacrificed at different time points. The blood was collected and weighed. The tissues, including thyroid gland, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, stomach (emptied), small intestine (full), and large intestine (full) were immediately dissected and washed. Each tissue was wrapped in aluminum foil and counted for 125I radioactivity on the detector. Data were corrected for physical decay of radioactivity.The distribution of the injected sample in the blood and in each organ was represented as the percentage of the injected dose (sample activity/total activity injected). The blood concentrations of NGO and NGO-PEG were represented by the percentage of the injected dose per gram. The blood circulation half-lives of 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG were calculated using 3P97 pharmacokinetic software based on the blood concentrations of 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours.Toxicology evaluationSixty mice were randomly assigned to three groups (20 mice per group). Each mouse was intravenously injected with Milli-Q water, 5 mg/kg NGO, or 5 mg/kg NGO-PEG through a tail vein. The mice were sacrificed at 24 hours, one week, one month, and 3 months (five mice per time point per group). Evaluation included assessment of body weight, a blood biochemical analysis, and a histopathological examination.Blood biochemical analysisThe mice were exsanguinated and sacrificed by removal of the eyeballs following anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mL of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Approximately 0.8 mL of blood from each mouse was collected. The blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and sera were collected for biochemical analysis. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, total protein, albumin, and globulin were evaluated using a clinical automatic chemistry analyzer (Type 7170A; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).Histopathological examinationAfter the mice were exsanguinated and sacrificed by removal of the eyeballs, the major organs, including the liver, lung, and spleen, were excised and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 7 days before further processing. These organs were then embedded in paraffin, thin-sectioned at 5 m, and mounted on glass microscope slides using standard histopathological techniques. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Massons trichrome and examined by optical microscopy (Axioskop 2 plus; Carl Zeiss, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA).Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences PASW Statistics version 18 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and all of the data are expressed as the mean standard error of the mean. A one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts post test was performed to determine the statistical significance (P0.05) between the indicated groups.ResultsMaterialsThe Fourier transform infrared spectrum of NGO showed the most characteristic features of graphene oxide: O-H stretching vibrations at 3,396 cm1, C=O stretching vibrations at 1,731 cm1, skeletal vibrations at 1,628 cm1, and C-O stretching vibrations at 1,078 cm1. The Raman spectrum of NGO consisted of two main features, ie, G mode at 1,594 cm1 and D mode at 1,347 cm1. The sheet structure of NGO was observed using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The atomic force microscopic images showed that the thickness of NGO was about 1 nm and that the majority of the NGO sheets were approximately 10800 nm in size. The radiochemical purity of 125I-NGO was greater than 94%. The 125I-NGO was stable in serum.PEG coatingThermal gravimetric analysis of NGO and NGO-PEG was used to determine the amount of PEG coating layer on the surface of NGO (Figure 1). The decomposition temperature of PEG ranges from approximately 328C to 439C (data not shown). NGO-PEG undergoes an obvious weight loss above 260C compared with NGO, indicating the presence of PEG on the surface of NGO. The mismatch of PEG weight loss around 260C may be due to the existence of NGO and its non-uniform size. The amount of the PEG coating layer in NGO-PEG was approximately 5.8%. The degree of functionality in NGO-PEG can be calculated as a molar functionality: (5.8/6,000)/(94.2/12) =0.01%. The average sizes of NGO and NGO-PEG by dynamic light scattering were 308.410.4 nm (polydispersity index 0.2760.028) and 314.36.2 nm (polydispersity index 0.2850.009), respectively. The zeta potential of NGO and NGO-PEG was 32.13.6 mV and 25.32.8 mV, respectively.Distribution of NGOTo evaluate the in vivo behavior of NGO suspended in Milli-Q water, NGO was labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method. After intravenous injection, the percentage of injected 125I-NGO in each organ was investigated at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours. At 10 minutes after injection, approximately 55.9% of the injected 125I-NGO arrived at the liver, whereas 10.0% and 2.2% reached the lung and spleen, respectively, and less than 2.0% was distributed to other organs (Figure 2A). The radioactivity in the liver and spleen decreased gradually with time, but no significant time-dependent changes were observed for the lung. The radioactivity in the liver, lung, and spleen remained at 26.9%, 6.8%, and 1.0%, respectively, at 6 hours. Meanwhile, similar studies of Na125I were performed to compare the in vivo distributions of 125I-NGO and Na125I at one hour and 6 hours (Figure 2B). It is obvious that there were significant differences between 125I-NGO and Na125I in the liver, lung, and spleen but not in other organs. These results indicated that NGO was mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen. In addition, the significant differences between 125I-NGO and Na125I demonstrated that 125I-NGO was stable in vivo and that the results related to the distribution of 125I-NGO were accurate and reliable.Furthermore, histopathological observation was conducted 24 hours after the mice were intravenously injected with 5 mg/kg NGO through a tail vein. As shown in Figure 2C, NGO sheets accumulated in the pulmonary vascular lumen and formed larger aggregations after injection, whereas no aggregations of NGO were found in the liver or spleen.Influence of PEG coating on distribution of NGOTo observe the influence of the PEG coating on the in vivo distribution of NGO at early stages, the percentages of injected 125I-NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours were compared with those of 125I-NGO-PEG. The results showed that the radioactivity of NGO-PEG in the liver, lung, and spleen was significantly lower than that of NGO at various time points, indicating that the PEG coating reduced the retention of NGO in these three organs (Figure 3A).Furthermore, the blood circulation half-lives of 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG were calculated to examine the effect of the PEG coating on the pharmacokinetic profile of NGO regarding NGO distribution in the blood (Figure 3B). The blood circulation half-life of 125I-NGO was approximately 5.35 hours, whereas that of 125I-NGO-PEG was approximately 6.29 hours, indicating that the PEG coating prolonged the blood circulation half-life of NGO. The volume of distribution of 125I-NGO was about 0.93 L/kg, whereas that of 125I-NGO-PEG was approximately 0.78 L/kg. The areas under curve for 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG were about 0.17 mgmin/mL and about 0.23 mgmin/mL, respectively.Influence of PEG coating on clearance of NGOThe influence of the PEG coating on the long-term fate of NGO was examined by histopathological observation of the main organs, including the liver, lung, and spleen, 3 months after injection (Figure 3C). The number of NGO aggregations in the liver, lung, and spleen from NGO-PEG-treated mice was significantly reduced compared with such aggregations in NGO-treated mice, indicating that the PEG coating promoted clearance of NGO from these organs. However, this observation also suggested the persistence of NGO and NGO-PEG after 3 months.Influence of PEG coating on toxicity of NGOFirst, the body weights of the mice in these three groups were investigated at various time points. The results showed that NGO caused an early decrease in body weight after 24 hours, whereas PEG significantly improved the NGO-induced weight loss (Figure 4). The body weights of all mice then increased slightly without statistically significant differences between the three groups at each time point until 3 months.To obtain detailed information regarding the influence of NGO and NGO-PEG on important organs, a blood biochemical analysis was performed (Figure 5). NGO induced an increase in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine after 24 hours, indicating the occurrence of acute injury to organs including the liver and kidney. The PEG coating significantly reduced these indices back to normal levels, indicating that the PEG coating effectively alleviated NGO-induced acute injury to these organs.Given the results of the distribution and blood biochemical analyses, histopathological changes in the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney were evaluated at early stages (Figure 6). Lung tissue treated with NGO exhibited damage to the alveolar architecture, moderate pulmonary parenchymal edema, neutrophil infiltration, congestion, and hemorrhage accompanied by NGO aggregations after 24 hours, indicating the occurrence of acute lung injury. With the PEG coating, the NGO-induced acute inflammatory responses were improved significantly, but NGO aggregations were still observed in sections of the lung. Moreover, NGO also induced early hepatic injuries characterized by the massive ballooning degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes surrounding the central vein, which could be alleviated by PEG coating of NGO. However, there were no obvious pathological changes in the spleen and kidneys of mice treated with either NGO or NGO-PEG after 24 hours (data not shown).The acute liver and lung injuries induced by NGO were subsequently gradually alleviated and became chronic inflammatory responses over time (Figure 7). The chronic pathological changes in these organs were assessed by standard hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome staining after 3 months (Figure 8). Compared with the Milli-Q water group, the liver and lung tissues of the group treated with NGO exhibited much more collagen deposition and tissue injury, indicating that NGO induced chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis. The NGO-induced chronic pathological changes in the liver and lung may originate from the acute hepatic and lung injuries discussed above. However, PEG coating significantly improved the NGO-induced chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis characterized by reduced collagen deposition. There were no chronic pathological changes observed in the spleen and kidneys after 3 months in either group (data not shown).Discussion and conclusionNGO is a promising new nanomaterial for drug delivery and tumor treatment. However, the in vivo distribution and toxicity of NGO has rarely been evaluated, even though these issues are critical for assessing the potential biomedical applications of NGO. Furthermore, the influence of a PEG coating on the distribution and toxicity of NGO has not been reported until now. In this study, we examined the in vivo behavior and toxicology of NGO in mice after intravenous injection. The influence of the PEG coating on the distribution and toxicity of NGO was investigated. The results showed that NGO particles with a size range of 10800 nm were mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen. Retention in the lung was partially due to NGO aggregation. PEG coating reduced the retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen, and promoted clearance of NGO from these organs, but NGO and NGO-PEG were still present after 3 months. Moreover, the PEG coating effectively reduced the early weight loss caused by NGO and alleviated NGO-induced acute tissue injuries, which can include damage to the liver, lung, and kidney, and chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis.It is well known that the reticuloendothelial system or the MPS is responsible for the retention of nanoparticles in tissues or organs.25 In the present study, retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen may be attributed to its uptake by the reticuloendothelial system or MPS. However, accumulation of NGO in the lung exhibited different time-related changes from the accumulation in the liver and spleen, implying the possibility of other mechanisms. Considering the size range of NGO from 10 nm to 800 nm, the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of NGO sheets with small and large sizes may be different. NGO sheets with small sizes can pass through the kidneys into urine and be rapidly eliminated by a renal route without obvious toxicity. Meanwhile, NGO sheets with large sizes may form aggregations or be captured by the MPS with obvious toxicity. The results of the histopathological observation demonstrated that blocking of the pulmonary blood vessels by NGO aggregations was partially responsible for retention of NGO in the lung.In this study, the PEG coating was accomplished by absorption rather than covalent binding between NGO and PEG.26 The adsorption of PEG on the surface of NGO might be a consequence of hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, and other weak interactions. The PEG coating may reduce retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen by providing steric hindrance that prevents protein binding and effectively decreases MPS uptake and formation of NGO aggregation.27 Furthermore, the PEG coating increased the blood concentration of NGO at each time point and prolonged the blood circulation half-life of NGO due to the reduced MPS uptake and formation of NGO aggregation.With respect to the long-term fate of NGO, the results of the histopathological observation show that the PEG coating promoted clearance of NGO from the liver, lung, and spleen, which may also be due to the reduced MPS uptake of NGO. NGO of smaller sizes may be quickly eliminated via the renal route, whereas NGO of larger sizes and NGO aggregates may be taken up by macrophages and cleared through the biliary pathway into the feces or by other mechanisms.28 However, the long-term existence of NGO and NGO-PEG in these organs may be due to the large numbers of NGO aggregations and the limited NGO clearance ability of the organism.In the present study, the influence of the PEG coating on the toxicity of NGO was determined using an evaluation system that included assessment of body weight, a blood biochemical analysis, and a histopathological examination. A relatively low dose of NGO (5 mg/kg) was chosen because of the increased mortality in mice that received a higher dose of NGO in the preliminary experiment, which may have been due to dyspnea resulting from blocking of the pulmonary blood vessels by NGO aggregations. NGO-induced effects, such as early weight loss, acute injury to tissues including the liver, lung, and kidney, and chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis, may be closely related to the physiochemical characteristics and distribution of NGO. NGO may interfere with the normal physiological function of important organs, such as the liver and lung, resulting in acute and chronic toxicity. However, PEG could effectively eliminate the NGO-induced side effects by regulating the in vivo behavior of NGO.There have been several studies of the in vivo distribution and toxicity of NGO after intravenous injection, and their results have shown some differences from those of our study. Zhang et al demonstrated that NGO (10800 nm, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline) was predominantly deposited in the lungs, resulting in pulmonary toxicity at a dosage of 10 mg/kg body weight.29 Yang et al reported that PEGylated NGO (1030 nm, suspended in water) accumulated in the reticuloendothelial system, including in the liver and spleen, and did not cause appreciable toxicity at a dosage of 20 mg/kg.30 In this study, NGO (10800 nm, suspended in Milli-Q water) was mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen, with acute and chronic toxicity, whereas the PEG coating reduced the retention of NGO and alleviated NGO-induced toxicity. Based on the analysis of our work and previous studies, the distribution of NGO appears to be closely related to its size and dispersion. Because the distribution of nanoparticles determines the toxic responses induced in organs, NGO of different sizes and dispersions show various results in terms of biocompatibility and toxicity.In conclusion, the PEG coating was able to reduce retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen, promote clearance of NGO from these organs, and alleviate NGO-induced acute and chronic toxicity. These results provide powerful evidence for future biomedical application of NGO. However, further toxicology studies are required. Future studies should concentrate on the influence of the physiochemical characteristics of NGO, including size, dispersion, and oxidative states, on the distribution and toxicity of NGO.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation of China (10775169, 10905086, 10975179), the Shanghai Municipal Natural Science Foundation (08ZR1422700, 08JC1422600), the Ministry of Health (2009ZX10004-301), the CAS Innovation Program (095501K), and the MOST973 Program (2006CB705605).

Although a number of anti-VEGFR therapies have been conceived, inefficient drug administration still limits their therapeutic efficacy and raises concerns of potential side effects. In the present work, we propose the use of uniform mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for VEGFR targeted positron emission tomography imaging and delivery of the anti-VEGFR drug (i.e., sunitinib) in human glioblastoma (U87MG) bearing murine models. MSNs were synthesized, characterized and modified with polyethylene glycol, anti-VEGFR ligand VEGF121 and radioisotope 64Cu, followed by extensive in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies. Our results demonstrated that a significantly higher amount of sunitinib could be delivered to the U87MG tumor by targeting VEGFR when compared with the non-targeted counterparts. The as-developed VEGF121-conjugated MSN could become another attractive nanoplatform for the design of future theranostic nanomedicine.VEGFRmesoporous silica nanoparticledrug deliveryvasculature targetingpositron emission tomographyNational Institutes of Health, United Statesdocument-id-old-9am506849pdocument-id-new-14am-2014-06849pccc-priceIntroductionAngiogenesis (i.e., the formation of new blood vessels) is a key hallmark of cancer growth and metastasis.1,2 Noninvasive imaging of angiogenesis can allow for much earlier cancer diagnosis and better prognosis, ultimately paving the way for personalized molecular medicine.3 It is well-known that, for a tumor to grow beyond 2 mm3, it must develop a network of blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen and to remove waste products.4 A number of growth factor receptor pathways form the molecular basis of angiogenesis, of which the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins and receptors is an integral member.5 Research also showed that activation of the VEGF pathway could trigger a signaling cascade that promotes endothelial cell growth and migration from pre-existing vasculature.6 Due to its well-established role in angiogenesis, radiolabeled ligands, such as VEGF121, bevacizumab, etc., which target the VEGF receptor (i.e., VEGFR), have successfully been developed for early and sensitive lesion detection by using positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging techniques.712 VEGF121, being a natural ligand of VEGFR and possessing high binding affinity for VEGFR-2, is an excellent candidate for targeted molecular imaging.13 However, direct radiolabeling of targeting ligands might alter their in vivo pharmacokinetics and compromise the binding affinity. Besides, the presence of only a few conjugation sites limits the potential of conjugating other functional moieties (e.g., fluorescent dyes, anticancer drugs) to the targeting ligands. Thus, engineering of a multifunctional platform, which can harbor VEGFR targeting ligands (e.g., VEGF121), imaging moieties (e.g., copper-64 [64Cu]) as well as therapeutic agents (e.g., hydrophilic and hydrophobic anticancer drugs) together in one nanosystem for effective VEGFR targeted cancer imaging and therapy, is highly desired.One of the major challenges pertaining to the suboptimal performance of many anticancer drugs is the low bioavailability and inefficient delivery to the target site.14 A lot of anticancer drugs are hydrophobic and need biocompatible drug delivery systems to enable improved bioavailability and facilitate easier intravenous administration. Silica is considered as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and silica based C-dots (or Cornell dots) are among the first inorganic nanoparticles to be approved for first-in-human trial by the FDA.15,16 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have recently been extensively studied as drug carriers owing to their large pore volumes, high surface area, superior biocompatibility, nontoxicity and easily modifiable surface.1719 MSNs, as exipients for drug formulations, can offer a promising approach to overcome the insolubility issue and deliver large payloads of hydrophobic small molecule drugs.20,21 Besides the potential for loading large amounts of drug, the silanol bearing surface can further be easily modified for enhanced pharmacokinetics or stimuli responsive release of the drugs.22 However, engineering of MSN for in vivo actively targeted drug delivery is still one of the major challenges in this field, and most of the previously reported silica-based drug delivery system studies were focused on passive tumor targeting, which relies on unpredictable tumor extravasation and enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect.14,20,2326Inspired by the pivotal role of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway in cancer and the advantages offered by MSNs, in this paper, we propose a VEGF pathway targeting potentially theranostic nanoplatform (Figure 1A) based on surface engineering of MSN for simultaneous noninvasive PET imaging and in vivo enhanced delivery of anti-VEGFR drug, sunitinib (SUN). Human glioblastoma (U87MG) bearing mice with suitable tumor sizes (60 mm3, having high VEGFR expression) were selected for in vivo active targeting study. Uniform sized MSN was first surface modified with amino groups, followed by chelator (e.g., S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid, or NOTA) conjugation, PEGylation, VEGF121 linkage and radioisotope (64Cu, t1/2 = 12.7 h) labeling. The mesoporous scaffolds were loaded with a small molecule hydrophobic drug to assess their drug loading and delivery efficacy. Sunitinib was chosen because it is a potent receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (including all VEGFRs) and has been clinically successful in providing improved progression free survival and tumor responses in a range of cancers.2731 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting the use of MSNs for VEGFR targeted PET imaging and in vivo enhanced drug delivery.Figure 1Synthesis and characterization of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN(SUN)-VEGF121.

Inset shows the digital photo and PET imaging of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-VEGF121 (3.54.0 mL fraction).Experimental SectionMaterialsK3-VEGF121 was purchased from Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). p-SCN-Bn-NOTA was acquired from Macrocyclics, Inc. (Dallas, TX). Mal-PEG5k-SCM was purchased from Creative PEGworks (Winston Salem, NC). NHS-fluorescein and Chelex 100 resin (50100 mesh), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), triethylamine (TEA), 3-aminopropylsilanetriol (APS), hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 25 wt %) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cy3-labeled secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, CA). Sunitinib malate was purchased from Tocris Biosciences (Minneapolis, MN). PD-10 columns were bought from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Absolute ethanol and sodium chloride (NaCl) were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Water and all buffers were of Millipore grade and pretreated with Chelex 100 resin to ensure that the aqueous solution was free of heavy metals. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.CharacterizationTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a FEI T12 microscope. Dilute solutions of as prepared and functionalized MSNs were placed dropwise onto carbon-coated copper grids and allowed to dry. TEM images were taken at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. DLS and zeta potential analysis were performed on Nano-Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd.).Synthesis of Uniform 80 nm Sized MSNsMSNs with a uniform diameter of 80 nm were synthesized using the soft template method as previously described in the literature.32 In a typical synthesis, CTAC (2 g) and TEA (20 mg) were dissolved in high Q water (20 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then 1 mL of TEOS was added rapidly and the resulting mixture was again stirred for 1 h in a 95 C water bath. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature. The pellet collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm was washed with water and ethanol to remove the residual reactants. The final product was extracted with a 1 wt % solution of NaCl in methanol at room temperature to completely remove the CTAC template. The process was carried out at least three times (24 h each time). After the final wash, the nanoparticles were suspended in 20 mL absolute ethanol for amine modification.Synthesis of Amine Modified MSNs (MSN-NH2)Amine modification of the as synthesized MSNs was carried out to enable further surface functionalization. To 20 mL of MSNs in absolute ethanol solution, 1 mL of APS was added and the system sealed tight. The mixture was kept in 8090 C water bath for 48 h. This was followed by repeated centrifugation and washing with ethanol to remove any unreacted APS. MSN-NH2 was then dispersed in water and concentration of amine groups was measured using ninhydrin-KCN (Kaiser) test.Synthesis of VEGF121-SHK3-VEGF121 was first incubated with Trauts Reagent (in 1:20 ratio) at pH 8.0 for 3 h to yield VEGF121-SH. The recombinant human VEGF121 used in this study had three lysine residues fused at the N-terminal to allow easier functionalization without affecting the VEGFR binding affinity. Free Trauts reagent was removed by purification by size exclusion chromatography on PD-10 columns, using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as mobile phase.Synthesis of NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and FITC-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF1211 mL of MSN-NH2 (containing 100 nmol of -NH2 groups) in water was reacted with p-SCN-Bn-NOTA (45 nmol, 5 L of 5 mg/mL solution in DMSO) at pH 8.5 to obtain NOTA-MSN-NH2. Unreacted p-SCN-Bn-NOTA was removed by centrifugation. To this, 5 mg (1000 nmol) of Mal-PEG5k-SCM was added and reacted for another 1 h at pH 8.5, resulting in NOTA-MSN-PEG-Mal. Excess PEG molecules were again removed by centrifugation. To obtain NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121, NOTA-MSN-PEG-Mal was reacted with VEGF121-SH in 1:5 ratio, in the presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at pH 7.5, overnight.To synthesize fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG-VEGF121 for flow cytometry and histology studies, 64 nmol of FITC in DMSO was reacted together with MSN-NH2 at pH 8.59 followed by NOTA, PEG and VEGF121 conjugations as described above.Sunitinib Loading and Release in VitroNOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 was obtained by mixing SUN (1 mg/mL in DMSO) with MSN-NH2 (3.5 mg) on a shaker for 24 h. Excess sunitinib-DMSO solution was removed by centrifugation, followed by subsequent washing with water for three times. NOTA, PEG and VEGF121 conjugations were carried out in further reactions, as outlined above. The final conjugate was dispersed in PBS for further in vitro and in vivo studies.SUN absorbance (absorbance maximum at 430 nm) determined with UVvis spectroscopy was used to determine the amount of SUN loaded into MSNs. Loading capacity was calculated using the following formula: (amount of SUN in MSN/amount of MSN) 100%. The release studies were carried out in PBS (pH 7.4 and pH 5.0) for 2 weeks. SUN loaded MSNs were dispersed in 1 mL of solution of both types. At predetermined time-points, the solutions were spun down in a centrifuge and supernatants collected and analyzed on a UVvis spectrometer. New solution was replenished after each time-point.Cell Lines and Animal ModelU87MG human glioblastoma multiforme, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and 4T1 murine breast cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). U87MG and 4T1 cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM) and RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) respectively, with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 C with 5% CO2. Cells were allowed to reach 75% confluence before use. All animal studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The U87MG tumor model was generated by subcutaneous injection of 2 106 cells in 100 L of a phosphate buffered saline (PBS):Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) (1:1) mixture into the front flank of six-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Tumor sizes were monitored every alternate day. Mice were used for in vivo experiments when the diameter of tumors reached 46 mm (typically 3 weeks after inoculation).In Vitro Flow CytometryBoth HUVEC and 4T1 cells were harvested and suspended in cold PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 5 106 cells/mL and then incubated with fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG-VEGF121 or fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG at a concentration of 5 nM for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed for three times with cold PBS and centrifuged for 5 min. A BD FACSCalibur four-color analysis cytometer, equipped with 488 and 633 nm lasers (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA), was used to analyze the cells and data interpretation was carried out with FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).64Cu Labeling and Serum Stability Studies148 MBq of 64CuCl2 was diluted in 300 L of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and added to NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 or NOTA-MSN-PEG and reacted at 37 C for 30 min under constant shaking. 64Cu labeled conjugates were then purified on PD-10 columns using Chelex-100 pretreated PBS as the mobile phase. The radioactivity fractions (typically eluting between 3.5 and 4.5 mL) were collected for further in vitro and in vivo experiments. The unreacted 64Cu fraction is expected to elute from the column after 6 mL of PBS. The whole procedure of 64Cu labeling and purification of the MSNs was completed in 90 10 min (n = 10).Serum stability studies of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG were carried out by incubating the radioconjugates in complete mouse serum at 37 C for up to 24 h (the time period of investigation for serial PET imaging, approximately two half-lives of 64Cu). The mixtures were sampled at different time-points and passed through 100 kDa cutoff filters. The filtrates were collected, and the radioactivity was measured. The retained 64Cu percentages were calculated for both 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG using the following equation:[(total radioactivity radioactivity in filtrate)/total radioactivity] 100%.In Vivo PET Imaging and Biodistribution StudiesTumor-bearing mice were each injected with 510 MBq of 64Cu-NOTAMSN-PEG-VEGF121 or 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG via tail vein before serial PET scans. PET scans on microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.), image reconstruction and ROI analysis of the PET data were performed using described previously procedures.33 Quantitative PET data was presented as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).After the last time-point at 22 h postinjection (p.i.), mice were euthanized and biodistribution studies were carried out to validate the %ID/g values and radioactivity distribution based on PET imaging in tumor-bearing mice. Blood, U87MG tumor, and major organs/tissues were collected and wet-weighed. The radioactivity in the tissues was measured using a -counter (PerkinElmer) and presented as %ID/g (mean SD).HistologyU87MG tumor-bearing mice were injected with fluorescein conjugated NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 or fluorescein conjugated NOTA-MSN-PEG (5 mg/kg of mouse body weight) and euthanized at 3 h p.i. (the point of maximum tumor uptake based on PET imaging). Organs including U87MG tumor, liver, spleen and muscle were excised, frozen and cryosectioned for histological analysis. The slices were stained for endothelial marker CD31 by using a rat antimouse CD31 antibody and a Cy3-labeled donkey antirat IgG. All images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope.In Vivo Enhanced SUN DeliveryFor drug delivery studies, SUN loaded MSN-NH2 was then conjugated with NOTA, PEG and VEGF121 as described previously to form NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121. Nontargeted nanoconjugates (i.e., NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG) were used as a control. For in vivo enhanced drug delivery study, U87MG tumor bearing mice were intravenously injected with NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 or NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG (5 mg nanoconjugate/kg of mouse). The mice were then sacrificed at 3 h p.i. U87MG tumor and the major organs were harvested and imaged on IVIS Spectrum preclinical imaging system (ex = 430 nm; em = 640 nm) under similar experimental conditions.Results and DiscussionSynthesis and Characterization of NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121Uniform MSNs with an average size of about 80 nm were synthesized using a well-established literature procedure.32 The nanoparticles possessed a worm-like mesoporous network of channels, as seen under TEM (Figure 1B), with a high specific surface area of 238 m2/g and pore size of 2.2 nm, described in our previous paper.34 To aid in further functionalization, as-prepared MSNs were surface modified with amino groups (Scheme 1), using APS (i.e., 3-aminopropylsilanetriol) to yield MSN-NH2. A hydrophobic drug (i.e., sunitinib) was then loaded into MSN by shaking the mixture of sunitinib and MSN in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 h. As-obtained MSN(SUN) exhibited the characteristic absorbance spectrum of SUN (absorbance max: 430 nm), indicating the successful loading of the drug into the mesoporous channels of MSN (Figure 1D). Characteristic excitation/emission spectra of SUN in DMSO are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The loading capacity of SUN in MSNs was found to be 100 mg of drug per g of nanoparticles. The drug release profile in PBS (pH 7.4) showed negligible release of SUN over 2 weeks, with enhanced release rate observed at lower pH values of around 5.0 (Figure 1E), possibly due to the protonation of silanol groups at lower pH, leading to the weakening of interactions between SUN and MSNs.Scheme 1Schematic Illustration of Stepwise Surface Modification and Drug Loading of MSNThe surface of monodispersed MSN (1) was modified with amino groups (NH2) to form MSN-NH2 (2). MSN-NH2 was then loaded with SUN in the presence of DMSO to form MSN(SUN) (3), followed by conjugation with NOTA and subsequent PEGylation to yield NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG (4). Further reaction of the nanoconjugates with VEGF121-SH yielded NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 (5). Finally, the nanoconjugates were radiolabeled with with 64Cu to form 64Cu-NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 (6).Afterward, desired amount of NOTA was added to obtain NOTA-MSN(SUN)-NH2. The nanoparticles were then PEGylated using heterobifunctional Mal-PEG5k-SCM; (Mal, malemide; SCM, succinidyl carboxy methyl ester), to generate NOTA-MSN-PEG-Mal. Thiolated VEGF121 (i.e., VEGF121-SH, see the Experimental Section) was then conjugated to obtain NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 based on the thiol-maleimide reaction chemistry. For in vivo PET imaging, radiolabeling with 64Cu was performed to yield the 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugate.TEM analysis indicates no obvious morphology changes before and after the surface modifications, as shown in Figure 1C. The hydrodynamic diameters and surface charge of as-synthesized nanoconjugates were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and -potential after each step of conjugation. As expected, DLS showed larger size when compared with that measured from TEM, owing to the presence of the hydrated shell. An increase in size after subsequent surface modifications reflects the successful addition of NOTA, PEG molecules and targeting moieties on the surface of MSN at each step (Table 1). In addition, surface charge varied as expected after each step of the conjugation; from 25.9 0.5 mV (MSN only) to +47.5 0.7 mV after amine modification, and then to 38.5 2.3, 10.9 0.7 and 10.2 0.7 mV, respectively, after subsequent NOTA, SCM-PEG-Mal and VEGF121 conjugations. The stability of NOTA-MSN-PEG5k-VEGF121 nanoconjugates were monitored over several weeks with no obvious aggregation observed (pH 7.4 in PBS).Table 1Variation in the DLS Diameters of the Nanoparticles after Successive Surface Modification stepsnanoparticlesDLS diameter (nm)PDIMSN88.52.20.0400.002MSN-NH2102.54.60.1370.007NOTA-MSN115.03.60.1370.019NOTA-MSN-PEG125.20.90.2510.019NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121129.11.50.1830.021Radiolabeling and Serum StabilityTo radiolabel NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and NOTA-MSN-PEG, both nanoconjugates were reacted with 64Cu for 30 min at pH 5.5, and purified on PD-10 columns using PBS as the mobile phase (to get rid of free nonchelated 64Cu). Our radiolabeling elution profile showed that 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 eluted between 3.5 and 4.5 mL from the column, whereas free 64Cu appears after 6.0 mL (Figure 1F). The radioactive fractions were then collected for further in vivo imaging. A phantom PET scan of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 (inset in Figure 1F) after PD-10 purification (fraction 3.54.5 mL) was also conducted to prove the success of radiolabeling.Stability of radiometals in certain tracers is a critically important aspect influencing the overall in vivo behavior and biodistribution. Research showed that free 64Cu could possibly transchelate with serum proteins and result in nonselective binding or off-target accumulation, leading to erroneous interpretation of the imaging data.35 Hence, the stability of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugates in whole mouse serum was carefully investigated. Our results showed an excellent stability for both nanoconjugates, with over 90% 64Cu radioisotopes still attached after the incubation in whole mouse serum for 24 h at 37 C (Figure S2, Supporting Information).In Vitro VEGFR TargetingTo assess whether VEGF121 maintains its binding affinity and specificity for VEGFR upon conjugation with MSN, systematic flow cytometry study was carried out. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that show a high level of VEGFR expression were chosen as the VEGFR positive cell line, whereas 4T1 (a murine breast cancer cell) was selected as the VEGFR negative cell line.MSN-NH2 was first reacted with NHS-fluorescein (ex = 494 nm; em = 518 nm, NHS: N-hydroxy-succinimidyl), followed by NOTA conjugation, PEGylation and VEGF121 conjugation to form fluorescein conjugated NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121. Nontargeted nanoparticles (i.e., fluorescein conjugated NOTA-MSN-PEG) were prepared using the same way but without the VEGF121 targeting moiety. As shown in Figure 2A, strong fluorescence signals were observed from HUVECs when incubated with fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG-VEGF121 (targeted group, 5 nM), whereas only background fluorescence was observed on incubation with fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG (non-targeted group, 5 nM). About a 50-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity was observed in the targeted group when compared with unstained cells (negative control). In contrast, low nonspecific binding was observed from VEGFR negative 4T1 breast cancer cells, as evidenced by background levels of fluorescence signal in all the groups (Figure 2B). All the results encouraged further in vivo investigation of VEGFR targeting efficacy. The binding of VEGF121 tagged MSN was further found to be highly specific and did not vary appreciably with the change of particle concentrations (Figure S3, Supporting Information). A similar enhancement in fluorescence intensities (50-fold) was observed when incubating with 25 nM and 100 nM fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG-VEGF121. The binding of fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG remained still low with increased concentration, indicating low nonspecific binding of our nanoconjugates in vitro (Figure S3, Supporting Information). To further confirm that the enhanced fluorescence was indeed due to specific binding of to VEGFR, in vitro blocking study was also performed. An excess amount (0.05 mg) of VEGF121 was added to HUVECs prior to the addition of fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG-VEGF121. Significantly low fluorescence enhancement (1.4 fold) was observed (Figure S3, Supporting Information), even with the addition of 100 nM of the targeted nanoconjugates, clearly indicating the specific VEGFR targeting of our nanoconjugates.Figure 2In vitro VEGFR targeting. Flow cytometry analysis of fluorescein conjugated MSN nanoconjugates in (A) HUVECs (VEGFR positive cell line), and (B) 4T1 murine breast cancer cell (VEGFR negative cell line).In Vivo VEGFR Targeted PET ImagingMalignant glioblastomas are among the most angiogenic cancers, with VEGF being the dominant angiogenic mediator.36 To determine the VEGFR targeting efficacy and in vivo biodistribution patterns of as-synthesized nanoconjugates, serial whole body PET scans were carried out at multiple time-points (0.6, 3, 6 and 22 h postinjection [p.i.]). For this purpose, about 7.411.1 MBq of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG were intravenously injected (i.v.) in U87MG glioblastoma xenografted mice (n = 3). Figure 3 shows the tumor (marked with an arrow) containing slices of the coronal PET images at various time-points. The data obtained from the region-of-interest (ROI) quantification of the PET images is also presented in Figure 4A,B.Figure 3In vivo VEGFR targeted PET imaging in U87MG tumor bearing mice. Coronal PET images of (A) 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and (B) 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG injected intravenously in U87MG tumor bearing mice at different time-points. The yellow arrows indicate the location of the tumor.Figure 4ROI quantification and biodistribution studies. Time-activity curves of the liver, U87MG tumor, blood, and muscle upon i.v. injection of (a) 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 (targeted group), and (b) 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG (non-targeted group). (c) U87MG tumor uptake comparison between targeted and non-targeted groups. The difference between U87MG tumor uptake in targeted group and non-targeted group was statistically significant (**P 0.01). (d) Ex vivo biodistribution study of two groups at 22 h p.i. (n = 3 for all groups).As apparent from the PET images, the uptake of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG in the liver was prominent at early time-points and declines gradually. Such a behavior is expected for intravenously injected nanomaterials and can be attributed to the hepatic clearance of the intravenously injected nanoparticles by liver, which functions as the major organ in the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Liver uptake of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG was 24.2 1.3 and 23.9 3.5 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of tissue, respectively, at 0.5 h p.i., decreasing gradually to 11.2 0.8 and 13.5 1.7%ID/g, respectively, at 22 h p.i. (n = 3).Successful in vivo VEGFR targeting was substantiated by the rapid and specific accumulation of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 (6.8 0.2%ID/g) in U87MG tumor as early as 0.5 h p.i., reaching a maximum of 7.8 0.2%ID/g at 3 h p.i. Nontargeted 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG nanoconjugates, on the other hand, showed much lower tumor uptake, peaking to 2.6 0.6%ID/g at 3 h p.i., indicating minimum passive targeting efficacy of the nanoparticle in U87MG tumor. It is of note that the uptake of the nanoconjugates in organs such as liver, spleen and muscle remained similar in both the targeted and non-targeted groups, while the tumor uptake remained significantly different at all time-points (Figure 4A,B). These results clearly indicate that the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the targeted and non-targeted nanoparticles are comparable; and thus, VEGFR specific binding was the main factor responsible for enhanced tumor uptake of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 over 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG. The stark contrast in the tumor uptake and tumor-to-muscle ratios between the targeted and non-targeted groups at different time points is also shown in Figure 4C and Table S3 (Supporting Information), respectively.Only two systematic in vivo active targeting studies with MSNs have been reported in the literature.34,37 Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, despite being an attractive target, nanoparticle mediated VEGFR targeting has only been reported once earlier, where VEGF121 conjugated quantum dots (QDs) were used for dual PET and NIRF (i.e., near-infrared fluorescence) imaging.38 It is noteworthy that the highest U87MG uptake of QD-VEGF121 reached about 4.2 0.5% ID/g at 22 h p.i. While VEGF121 conjugated MSN showed a much higher and faster accumulation in the same tumor model in the current study. Moreover, the off-target uptake of our nanoconjugates was much lower (about 24%ID/g) compared to the previous study, which was reported to be about 50%ID/g uptake in liver.38 These results further validate the superiority of mesoporous silica nanostructures as potential vehicles for tumor vasculature targeted imaging.Ex Vivo Biodistribution StudiesEx vivo organ distribution studies were performed in all mice after terminal PET scans at 22 h p.i. (Figure 4D). The biodistribution values corroborated well with ROI quantification values from PET images (taken at 22 h p.i.) for both targeted and non-targeted cohorts. As expected, the major clearance organs, i.e. liver, kidney and intestine, showed enhanced accumulation of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 (12.1 0.7, 7.8 0.7 and 2.6 0.4%ID/g, respectively), indicating that the nanoparticles cleared through both hepatobiliary and renal routes. Tumor uptake was still prominent at 4.5 1.2%ID/g. Moreover, apart from the tumor, the %ID/g values in all the major organs remained similar for the non-targeted group, further confirming the VEGFR specific tumor uptake of our nanoconjugates. The good agreement between PET and biodistribution quantification data supports the validity of noninvasive serial PET scans and ROI analyses in reflecting the real in vivo fate of surface modified MSNs.Histological AnalysisTo fully understand the biodistribution pattern in vivo and confirm PET imaging results, immunofluorescence staining studies were performed. For this purpose, fluorescein labeled NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 and NOTA-MSN-PEG nanoparticles were administered intravenously in much higher doses (15 mg nanoconjugates/kg of mouse body weight) in U87MG tumor bearing mice. U87MG tumor, liver, spleen and muscle were excised, frozen and cryosectioned after euthanization of the mice (n = 3) at 3 h p.i.Frozen tissue slices (6 m thick) were stained for vascular endothelial marker CD31, using rat antimouse CD31 primary antibody and Cy3 labeled donkey antirat secondary antibody using a previously reported protocol.39 The stained slices were observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. The green fluorescence from fluorescein in Figure 5 indicates the location of the nanoparticles and the red fluorescence marks the position of the vessels. Excellent overlay of the red and green signals in the U87MG tumor of the targeted group indicates the vasculature specific uptake of MSN-PEG-VEGF121 with little extravasation. Consistent with PET imaging and biodistribution studies, significant green signals were observed in both the liver and spleen tissue slices, indicating high nanoparticle uptake in these organs. However, very weak overlap was observed between the red and green fluorescence signals, indicating the nonspecific nature of the nanoparticle accumulation in these organs, due to the macrophage capture or other mechanisms. As expected, no significant green fluorescence was observed in muscle tissue, which correlated well with the PET findings. Overall, our ex vivo histological analysis of the tissues further confirms the VEGFR specific uptake of our nanoconjugates.Figure 5Ex vivo histology analysis.

Merged images are also shown at the right panel. Scale bar: 100 m.In Vivo Enhanced Drug DeliveryEfficacy of a drug depends largely on its efficient delivery to the disease site, specifically and in large amounts. The use of MSNs as an ideal platform to carry drugs, especially hydrophobic and aromatic compounds, has been envisaged for over a decade.20,22,25,26 However, few examples of in vivo tumor targeted drug delivery have been reported.34 Given the importance of VEGF/VEGFR cascade in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, a number of anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies have been used to effectively curb cancer. However, nonspecific systemic delivery of a drug can lead to several side effects, sometimes even mortality.We hypothesized that loading an anti-VEGFR drug into NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanocarriers can be an effective strategy to improve the treatment efficacy of the drug and reduce toxicity to the nontarget organs. Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, SUN, a hydrophobic, anti-VEGFR small molecule drug, was selected for demonstrating the capability for in vivo enhanced drug delivery.To achieve targeted SUN delivery in vivo, MSN(SUN) was stepwise conjugated to NOTA, PEG and VEGF121, as described earlier, to produce NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugates (Figure 6A). A separate batch of NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG was also synthesized to serve as a non-targeted control. Equal concentration solutions of NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 and NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG (500 g/mL) were used for in vivo image-guided drug delivery studies. The final dose of SUN was about 5 mg of SUN per kg of mouse. The U87MG bearing mice were sacrificed at 3 h p.i. Fluorescence from the drug was harnessed to image the tumor along with the major organs, using an IVIS Spectrum imaging system (ex = 430 nm; em = 640 nm). An equal concentration of MSNs without SUN was also injected in a separate group of mice to serve as the negative control. Enhanced delivery of SUN to U87MG tumors was achieved in targeted group when compared with the non-targeted group (Figure 6C). Moreover, the negative control group showed only background levels of fluorescence in all organs, lower than even the non-targeted group, indicating that autofluorescence from the organs was not responsible for the observed effects. The accumulation in RES organs, such as liver and spleen, appeared low, contrary to the PET imaging results. This anomaly can be explained on the basis of different absorption and scattering of SUN emission (around 580 nm) signal by different tissues. Therefore, dark colored organs, such as liver and spleen, may have strongly absorbed the emission wavelength from SUN, resulting in a weaker optical signal, compared to the light colored tumor tissues. As such, optical imaging cannot reliably measure the accurate absolute uptake of MSN(SUN) in different organs. However, it can serve as a handy tool to compare the drug uptake in U87MG tumors from the targeted and non-targeted groups. About a 2-fold difference was observed between the two groups, clearly demonstrating the superiority of using VEGF121 targeted MSNs for enhanced delivery of anti-VEGFR drugs over passively targeted nanosystems.Figure 6In vivo enhanced drug delivery study.

All images were acquired using an IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging system (ex = 430 nm; em = 640 nm).ConclusionIn conclusion, VEGFR targeting with nanoparticles is a vastly unexplored area in the literature and can serve to home imaging agents and therapeutics simultaneously and specifically to tumor vasculature. In this study, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of VEGFR targeted mesoporous silica nanostructures. Extensive in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies confirmed the stability and VEGFR specific targeting ability of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugates. In vivo PET imaging studies indicated an almost 3-fold enhancement in the tumor accumulation of targeted MSNs when compared to the non-targeted group, while the uptake in the other organs remained similar. The excellent target specificity of our nanoconjugates was also harnessed for preliminary site specific delivery of an anti-VEGFR drug (i.e., sunitinib) to U87MG tumors. Overall, the encouraging results obtained in our study indicate that VEGFR targeting with VEGF121 conjugated, anti-VEGFR therapeutics loaded MSN may represent a major advance for angiogenesis imaging and inhibition in lethal cancers.Supporting Information AvailableTables S1S2 list the uptake of nanoconjugates in targeted and non-targeted cohorts at different time-points.

However, limited progress has been made in developing MSN-based multimodality imaging agents to image tumors. We describe the successful conjugation of, copper-64 (64Cu, t1/2 = 12.7 h), 800CW (a near-infrared fluorescence [NIRF] dye), and TRC105 (a human/murine chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody) to the surface of MSN via well-developed surface engineering procedures, resulting in a dual-labeled MSN for in vivo targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging/NIRF imaging of the tumor vasculature. Pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting efficacy/specificity in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice were thoroughly investigated through various in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experiments. Dual-labeled MSN is an attractive candidate for future cancer theranostics.vasculature targetingpositron emission tomography (PET) imagingnear-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imagingmesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)National Institutes of Health, United Statesdocument-id-old-9mp500306kdocument-id-new-14mp-2014-00306kccc-priceIntroductionVasculature targeting of tumor angiogenesis can be done based on biomarkers on the surface of tumor endothelial cells and does not require nanoparticle extravasation.1 Vasculature targeted ligands, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and arginineglycineaspartic acid (RGD) peptides, have been conjugated to the surface of different functional nanoparticles, including but not limited to, quantum dots (QDs),2 single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs),3 and nanographene oxide (GO),4,5 for enhanced tumor targeted imaging and drug delivery.TRC105 (a human/murine chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody) is a promising vasculature targeting moiety,6 which binds to both human and murine CD105 (endoglin), a vascular-specific marker for tumor angiogenesis.7,8 Using TRC105 antibody and its fragments (i.e., TRC105(Fab) or F(ab)2), we reported the first positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of CD105 expression in cancer,9,10 demonstrating the potential of CD105 for cancer-targeted imaging and therapy.Fluorescence imaging, especially near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, is economical and highly sensitive in certain scenarios. However, it is not quantitative in nature.11 PET imaging, in contrast, has superb tissue penetration of signal, high sensitivity, and quantitative evaluation of the in vivo biodistribution.12 The combination of PET with NIRF may provide more complementary information than either single modality alone and has attracted increasing interests recently.1320 For example, to mitigate the qualitative nature of QDs optical imaging, copper-64 (64Cu, t1/2 = 12.7 h) labeled QDs have been developed for in vivo PET/NIRF targeted dual-modality imaging using RGD peptides as the targeting ligands.13Mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) possesses many attractive properties and have been intensively investigated as a novel and biocompatible drug delivery system.2124 Although MSN itself emits no light, many strategies have been developed for engineering fluorescent MSN that can be tracked by optical imaging. For example, fluorescent dyes with varied excitation/emission combinations have been chemically linked to the surface or loaded into the matrix of MSN for studying the dynamic distribution of MSN in vivo.25,26 Moreover, optical nanocrystals, including QDs27 and upconversion nanoparticles,28 have also been encapsulated into MSN for imaging deeper tissues. Efforts have focused on the design of various fluorescent MSNs for in vivo cancer imaging, but little progress has been made with respect to in vivo tumor targeted imaging of the functionalized MSN.Herein, using TRC105 (Fab) vascular targeting moiety as the targeting ligand, we report the first example of 64Cu (a PET tracer) and 800CW (a NIRF dye) labeled MSN for PET/NIRF dual-modality imaging of the tumor vasculature. Pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting efficacy/specificity in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice were thoroughly investigated through various in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experiments. Our dual-labeled MSN could become a promising candidate for future image-guided drug delivery and targeted cancer therapy.Experimental SectionMaterialsTRC105 was provided by TRACON Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA). PD-10 columns were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). IR Dye 800CW-NHS (NHS denotes N-hydroxysuccinimide) ester was acquired from LI-COR Biosciences Co. (Lincoln, NE). SCM-PEG5k-Mal was obtained from Creative PEGworks. NOTA-SCN (i.e., 2-S-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) was acquired from Macrocyclics, Inc. (Dallas, TX). NHS-fluorescein, Chelex 100 resin (50100 mesh), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ammonia (NH3H2O), triethylamine (TEA), 3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APS), dimethyl sulfoxide, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 25 wt %), and Kaiser test kit were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Trauts reagent (2-IminothiolaneHCl) and Ellmans reagent (5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or DTNB) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Water and all buffers were of Millipore grade and pretreated with Chelex 100 resin to ensure that the aqueous solution was free of heavy metals. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.Generation of TRC105(Fab)Procedures for the synthesis of TRC105(Fab) were the same as we reported previously.29 Typically, TRC105 (2 mg/mL) was digested out in a reaction buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 10 mM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], and 80 mM cysteine hydrochloride) for 4 h at 37 C, with immobilized papain/TRC105 at a weight ratio of 1:40. Afterward, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 5000g for 1 min to remove the immobilized papain. The supernatant was purified by size exclusion column chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column to yield TRC105(Fab), using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as the mobile phase.For the thiolation of TRC105(Fab), in 700 L (1.5 mg/mL) of TRC105(Fab) was added 50 L (2 mg/mL) of Trauts reagent and adjusted the pH to 8.0 using 0.1 M Na2CO3. The mixture was kept shaking for 2 h at room temperature. As-synthesized TRC105(Fab)-SH was purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. Fraction from 3.0 to 4.0 mL was collected and concentrated using a 10 k filter at 5000 rpm for 15 min. The final concentration of TRC105(Fab)-SH was found to be about 1.7 mg/mL (300 L).Synthesis of MSNProcedures for the synthesis of 80 nm sized MSN were the same as we reported previously.30 In a typical synthesis, CTAC (2 g) and TEA (20 mg) were dissolved in 20 mL of high Q water and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Afterward, 1.0 mL of TEOS was added rapidly and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at 95 C in a water bath. The mixture was then cooled down, collected by centrifugation, and washed with water and ethanol to remove residual reactants. Subsequently, the product was extracted for 24 h with a 1 wt% solution of NaCl in methanol at room temperature to remove the template CTAC. This process was carried out for at least three times to ensure complete removal of CTAC.For amino group modification, as-synthesized MSN was first dispersed in 20 mL of absolute ethanol, followed by addition of 1 mL of APS. The system was sealed and kept at 8690 C in a water bath for 48 h. Afterward, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with ethanol for several times to remove the residual APS. The MSN-NH2 could be well-dispersed in water, and the concentration of NH2 groups (nmol/mL) was measured using a Kaiser test kit.Synthesis of NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab)To conjugated MSN with 800CW, 2 nmol of 800CW-NHS ester was mixed with MSN-NH2 (with 100 nmol of NH2 groups) and reacted for 2 h at room temperature (pH 8.59.0) to form MSN-800CW-NH2. Then, NOTA-SCN (53 nmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide was allowed to react with MSN-800CW-NH2 at pH 8.5 to obtain NOTA-MSN-800CW-NH2. Afterward, 2 mg (400 nmol) of SCM-PEG5k-Mal was added and reacted for another 2 h, resulting in NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-Mal. NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab) could be obtained by reacting TRC105(Fab)-SH with NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-Mal at room temperature for overnight. The final sample was kept at 4 C before 64Cu labeling. Note, both NOTA and PEG were omitted from the acronyms of the final nanoconjugates for clarity considerations in the following sections.Flow CytometryCells were first harvested and suspended in cold PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 5 106 cells/mL and then incubated with fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (targeted group) or fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW (non-targeted group) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and centrifuged for 5 min. Afterward, the cells were washed and analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur four-color analysis cytometer, which is equipped with 488 and 633 nm lasers (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). A blocking experiment was also performed in cells incubated with the same amount of fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab), where 500 g/mL of unconjugated TRC105 was added to evaluate the CD105 specificity of fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab).Radiolabeling with 64Cu64CuCl2 (74148 MBq) was diluted in 300 L of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and added to MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) or MSN-800CW. Note, all MSN nanoconjugates were already conjugated with NOTA. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 C for 30 min with constant stirring. 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) and 64Cu-800CW-MSN were purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. The radioactivity fractions (typically between 3.5 and 4.5 mL) were collected for further in vivo imaging experiments. After 6 mL of PBS, the unreacted 64Cu started to elute from the column.4T1 Murine Breast Cancer ModelAll animal studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To generate the 4T1 tumor model, 45 week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA), and tumors were established by subcutaneously injecting 2 106 cells, suspended in 100 L of 1:1 mixture of RPMI 1640 and Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), into the front flank of mice. The tumor sizes were monitored every other day, and the animals were subjected to in vivo experiments when the tumor diameter reached 58 mm.PET/NIRF Imaging and Biodistribution StudiesPET scans at various time points postinjection (pi) using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.), image reconstruction, and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of the PET data were performed similarly to that described previously.31 Quantitative PET data were presented as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). Tumor-bearing mice were each injected with 510 MBq of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) or 64Cu-MSN-800CW via tail vein before serial PET scans. Another group of three 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were each injected with 1 mg of unlabeled TRC105 at 1 h before 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) administration to evaluate the CD105 specificity of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) in vivo (i.e., blocking experiment).After the last PET scans at 48 h pi, biodistribution studies were carried out to confirm that the %ID/g values based on PET imaging truly represented the radioactivity distribution in tumor-bearing mice. Mice were euthanized, and blood, 4T1 tumor, and major organs/tissues were collected and wet-weighed. The radioactivity in the tissue was measured using a gamma-counter and presented as %ID/g (mean SD).For in vivo NIRF imaging, each 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse was injected with MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (targeted group) with the amount of 800CW estimated to be 400 pmol. The mouse was then imaged using an IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging system (Ex = 745 nm, Em = 800 nm) at 4 h pi. For non-targeted and blocking groups, mice were injected with MSN-800CW and MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (together with 1 mg blocking dose of free TRC105), respectively, with equal amount of 800CW dyes.Results and DiscussionSynthesis and Characterizations of Thiolated TRC105(Fab)Thiolated TRC105(Fab), i.e., TRC105(Fab)-SH, was generated following our previous reported procedures with an addition thiolation step (Figure 1a).29 After papain digestion of full TRC105 antibody, a Sephadex G 75 column was used to separate TRC105(Fab) from other components in the reaction mixture. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was then used to confirm the successful generation of TRC105(Fab), where the disappearance of the TRC105 band (148 kDa, lane 2 in Figure 1b) and the appearance of pure TRC105(Fab) band (47.5 kDa, lane 3 in Figure 1b) were shown. Trauts reagent was later used for the thiolation of TRC105(Fab), forming TRC105(Fab)-SH. The presence of SH groups was further confirmed by using Ellmans reagent. Taken together, these results indicate the complete digestion of TRC105 after papain treatment to yield high purity TRC105(Fab) and the successful thiolation of TRC105(Fab) to form TRC105(Fab)-SH for further bioconjugations.Figure 1Synthesis and characterization of TRC105(Fab). (a) Schematic illustration showing the generation of TRC105(Fab) and its thiolation. (b) SDS-PAGE of molecular weight markers (lane 1), intact TRC105 antibody (lane 2), and TRC105(Fab) after purification on the Sephadex G-75 column (lane 3).Synthesis and Characterizations of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab)Multiple steps of surface engineering were required for the synthesis 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab), as shown in Scheme 1. As-synthesized uniform MSN (1) was first functionalized with amino groups (NH2) with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APS), to form MSN-NH2 (2), leaving amino groups on the surface for further conjugation. Successful NH2 modification was confirmed by ninhydrin testing (Supportiong Information Figure S1). The desired amount of NIRF dyes (800CW-NHS ester) and NOTA-SCN (a 64Cu chelator) and were then reacted with MSN-NH2 at pH 8.59 to produce NOTA-MSN-800CW-NH2 (3). Afterward, the heterobifunctional succinimidyl carboxy methyl ester-poly ethylene glycol(5 kDa)-maleimide (SCM-PEG5k-Mal) was used to generate NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-Mal (4), which was then reacted with TRC105(Fab)-SH to yield NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab) (5). Lastly, the NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab) was labeled with 64Cu to form the 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab) nanoconjugate (6), abbreviated as 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). Because all the MSN nanoconjugates will contain the same NOTA and PEG chains (5 kDa), both NOTA and PEG were omitted from the acronyms of the final nanoconjugates for clarity.Scheme 1Schematic Illustration of the Synthesis of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab)Uniform MSN nanoparticle (1) was first modified with NH2 groups with APS to form MSN-NH2 (2). As-synthesized MSN-NH2 was then subjected to 800CW and NOTA conjugation to yield NOTA-MSN-800CW-NH2 (3). Afterwards, PEGylation step was introduced to render the stability of NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-Mal (4) in PBS, at the same time adding maleimide groups. NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab) (5) could be obtained by reacting TRC105(Fab)-SH with 4 at room temperature. 64Cu-labeling was performed in the last step to generate 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-800CW-PEG-TRC105(Fab) (6), short for 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab).Figure 2a shows the representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of 80 nm sized uniform MSN, which was synthesized following as described.30 No obvious changes in the morphology of MSN were observed after multistep surface modifications, as evidenced by TEM image of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (Figure 2b). Successful conjugation of 800CW to MSN was confirmed by the NIRF imaging of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (inset in Figure 2b) using the IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging system (Ex = 745 nm, Em = 800 nm). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and potential measurements indicated the final Z-average size and surface charge of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) to be 175.3 9.7 nm and 3.25 0.8 mV (pH 7.4, PBS), respectively.Figure 2Synthesis and characterization of MSN and MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). TEM images of (a) pure MSN, (b) MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). Insets in (a) and (b) show the schemes of MSN and MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). An optical image of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) acquired from IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging system (Ex = 745 nm, Em = 800 nm) is also shown in the upper right portion of (b).In Vitro CD105 Targeting of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab)Previously, we have demonstrated that fluorescein conjugated TRC105(Fab) binds with high avidity and specificity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),29 indicating that papain digestion does not affect antigen recognition. To assess CD105 targeting efficiency of MSN nanoconjugates, a flow cytometry study using HUVECs was also performed after NHS-fluorescein was conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles. Flow cytometry results (Figure 3) indicated that incubation with fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) significantly enhanced the mean fluorescence intensity of HUVECs, compared to fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW. The specificity of in vitro CD105 targeting with MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) was confirmed in the blocking study, where only background level uptake of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) was observed after blocking HUVECs with a large dose of free TRC105 (500 g/mL).Figure 3Flow cytometry analysis of MSN nanoconjugates in HUVECs (CD105 positive) after 30 min incubation and subsequent washing. Targeted group: fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). Non-targeted group: fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW. Blocking group: fluorescein conjugated MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) with a blocking dose of TRC105 (500 g/mL).In Vivo PET/NIRF Dual Modal CD105-Targeted Imaging of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab)For in vivo tumor targeted PET imaging, both MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) and MSN-800CW were labeled with 64Cu for in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. As-synthesized 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (targeted group) and 64Cu-MSN-800CW (non-targeted group) were purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. The radioactivity fractions (typically elute between 3.0 and 4.0 mL) were collected for in vivo experiments. Unreacted 64Cu eluted from the column by the 6 mL fractions.In vivo tumor targeted imaging was carried out in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice, which express a high level of CD105 on the tumor neovasculature.7,8 Each mouse was intravenously (iv) injected with 510 MBq of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) or MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (had 400 pmol of dyes) for PET/NIRF imaging to show in vivo biodistribution pattern as well as tumor accumulation (Figures 4, 5 and 6). Non-targeted and blocking groups were also included to assess the targeting specificity of dual-labeled MSN nanoconjugates. Quantitative data obtained from ROI analysis of these PET images are also shown in Supporting Information Table S1S3.Figure 4Serial coronal PET images of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at different time points postinjection of (a) 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab), (b) 64Cu-MSN-800CW, and (c) 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) with a blocking dose of TRC105 (1 mg/mouse). Tumors are indicated by yellow arrowheads.Figure 5In vivo NIRF imaging of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at 4 h postinjection.

Tumors are indicated by yellow arrowheads. Each mouse was iv injected with MSN nanoconjugates with equal amounts of 800CW dyes (400 pmol). All images were acquired by using IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging system (Ex = 745 nm, Em = 800 nm).Figure 6Quantitative analysis of the PET data. (a) Timeactivity curve of the liver, 4T1 tumor, blood, and muscle upon iv injection of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) (targeted group, n = 3). (b) Timeactivity curve of tumor-to-muscle (T/M), tumor-to-blood (T/B), and tumor-to-liver (T/L) ratios from the same targeted group (n = 3). (c) Comparison of 4T1 tumor uptake among the three groups. The differences between 4T1 tumor uptake of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) and the two control groups were statistically significant (**P 0.01) in all cases. (d) Biodistribution of three groups in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at the end of the PET scans at 48 h pi (n = 3).The accumulation of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) in the 4T1 tumor was clearly demonstrated in PET imaging and was found to be 5.4 0.2%ID/g at 4 h pi, as shown in Figures 4a and 6a and Supporting Information Table S1 (n = 3). In contrast, the 4T1 tumor uptake of 64Cu-MSN-800CW was found to be 2%ID/g at all of the time points examined (n = 3; Figure 4b, Supporting Information Figure S2a and Table S2), indicating that TRC105(Fab) conjugation was required for enhanced tumor accumulation of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) in vivo. To further confirm the CD105 targeting specificity of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab), blocking studies were performed. The administration of a blocking dose (1 mg/mouse) of free TRC105 at 1 h before 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) injection significantly reduced tumor uptake to 2.3 0.2%ID/g at 4 h pi (n = 3, Figure 4c, Supporting Information Figure S2b and Table S3), demonstrating the CD105 specific targeting of 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) in vivo. Figure 6c further summarizes the comparison of 4T1 tumor uptake of three groups at different time points. 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) showed the highest tumor uptake throughout the study period.In vivo NIRF imaging was used to further confirm the enhanced accumulation of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). Different MSN nanoconjugates which contained equal amounts of dyes (400 pmol) were injected intravenously into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. In vivo NIRF images that were generated at 4 h pi (when the nanoparticles showed the highest tumor accumulation based on the PET imaging, shown in Figure 4a) were acquired and are shown in Figure 5. A significantly stronger signal from the targeted group was observed compared to the non-targeted and blocking groups, indicating the successful detection by NIRF imaging of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) nanoconjugates. Notably, the liver and spleen were the major organs for the accumulation of MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab). However, due to the difference in scattering behaviors and depth, only 800CW emission signalsfrom xenograft 4T1 tumor on the surface of mouse skin were detected by the IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging system. Taken together, these data demonstrated the CD105 specificity of dual-modality PET/NIRF targeted imaging using 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) in vivo.The conjugate 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) also improved tumor-to-muscle (T/M) biodistribution ratios. As shown in Figure 6b, T/M value of the targeted group was estimated to be 5.2 0.2 at 0.5 h pi and increased up to 7.3 1.1 at 4 h pi, which was significantly higher than that of non-targeted and blocking groups (Supporting Information Figure S2c,d and Table S4S6). Similar to other TRC105-conjugated nanoparticles,4,5,30 besides tumor accumulation, most of the 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) nanoconjugates were cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) with liver uptake found to be 23.2 3.5%ID/g at 0.5 h pi, decreasing gradually to 9.2 0.6%ID/g by 48 h pi (n = 3; Figures 4a and 6a, and Supporting Information Table S1), which was validated by the ex vivo biodistribution study (Figure 6d). Similar trends were also observed in the non-targeted and blocking groups (Supporting Information Figure S2a,b and Table S2S3).ConclusionIn conclusion, we report the in vivo tumor vasculature targeted PET/NIRF dual-modality imaging using well-functionalized 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) nanoconjugates. Pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting efficacy/specificity in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice were thoroughly investigated through various in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experiments. Vascular targeting led to 2-fold enhancement of tumor accumulation over passive targeting alone. Other targeting ligands could also be conjugated to MSN for further improvement of tumor accumulation in vivo. Given the presence of tunable pore size and larger surface area that could accommodate therapeutic agents, as-designed 64Cu-MSN-800CW-TRC105(Fab) could be employed as both imaging and therapeutic agents.Supporting Information AvailableNinhydrin testing, tables of PET region-of-interest quantifications, quantitative analysis of PET imaging data from non-targeted and blocking groups.

However, possibly due to the lack of efficient in vivo targeting strategy and well-developed surface engineering techniques, engineering of HMSN for in vivo active tumor targeting, quantitative tumor uptake assessment, multimodality imaging, biodistribution and enhanced drug delivery have not been achieved to date. Here, we report the in vivo tumor targeted positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dual-modality imaging and enhanced drug delivery of HMSN using a generally applicable surface engineering technique. Systematic in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed to investigate the stability, tumor targeting efficacy and specificity, biodistribution and drug delivery capability of well-functionalized HMSN nano-conjugates. The highest uptake of TRC105 (which binds to CD105 on tumor neovasculature) conjugated HMSN in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model was ~10%ID/g, 3 times higher than that of the non-targeted group, making surface engineered HMSN a highly attractive drug delivery nano-platform for future cancer theranostics.Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HMSN), with a large cavity inside each original mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN, a well-known nanocarrier which has been intensively investigated for drug delivery applications since 200012), has recently gained increasing interests due to their tremendous potential as more advantageous nano-platform for cancer imaging and therapy34. The last several years have witnessed a rapid development in engineering of functionalized HMSNs (f-HMSNs) with various types of inorganic functional nanocrystals integrated into the system for imaging and therapeutic applications56789. For example, Gd3+-doped upconversion nanoparticle encapsulated HMSN has been developed for the integration of optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chemotherapy and radiotherapy10. Another fascinating study is the combination of ultrasound imaging and MRI within one single HMSN, where MRI could potentially be employed as the pre-surgical evaluation tool while ultrasound can be exploited for real-time guidance during high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy11.In spite of the progress, most of the existing reports have been focused on the design of sophisticated f-HMSNs without fully examining their potential for actively targeted cancer imaging and/or therapy after systemic intravenous (i.v.) administration. Currently, very few reports about the quantitative assessment of in vivo tumor uptake, biodistribution and clearance studies of HMSN exist in the literature. Applying HMSN to in vivo targeted imaging and drug delivery is still considered as one of the major challenges in this field, possibly due to the lack of efficient in vivo targeting strategy and well-developed surface engineering techniques.Recently, we reported the first example of in vivo tumor targeting and enhanced drug delivery of TRC105 (a human/murine chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which binds to both human and murine CD10512) antibody conjugated MSN, and demonstrated the promising potential in applying tumor vasculature targeting strategy to functionalized nanoparticles for possible better therapeutic outcome13. However, the drug loading capacity of MSN needs to be further improved and the highest tumor uptake was not ideal (~6 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue [%ID/g]).Here, we report the in vivo tumor targeted positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dual-modality imaging and enhanced drug delivery of HMSN by using a generally applicable surface engineering method. The anti-cancer drug loading capacity of HMSN was found to be 315 times higher than previously reported MSN. By using CD105 (also known as endoglin, which is a validated marker for tumor angiogenesis and almost exclusively expressed on proliferating tumor endothelial cells1415) based tumor vasculature targeting strategy, we achieved over 3-fold higher tumor uptake (~10%ID/g at 4h post-injection [p.i.]) in targeted group when compared with the non-targeted group (~3%ID/g at 4h p.i.). Systematic in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the stability, targeting efficacy and specificity, biodistribution and drug delivery capability of well-functionalized HMSN nano-conjugates. With the growing interests in using HMSN as a drug delivery nano-platform, this study may pave the way for future cancer theranostics using HMSN, since silica is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)4.ResultsSynthesis and characterizationUniform HMSN with an average particle size of 150nm was synthesized following the literature procedures with improved Na2CO3-etching process16. Generally, three steps were involved. Firstly, uniform ~100nm sized dense silica (dSiO2) nanoparticles were prepared as hard templates using a modified Stber method17. Secondly, shell thickness controllable MSN layer was coated on each dSiO2 using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (i.e. CTAC) as the soft templates at 80C, forming dSiO2@MSN(CTAC) (Figure 1a, dark core represents dSiO2 core, while lighter shell is MSN). Thirdly, as-synthesized dSiO2@MSN(CTAC) together with free CTAC (~66.7mg/mL) in the solution was transferred to 50C water bath, and kept etching for 30min after addition of Na2CO3 (21.2mg/mL). In comparison with previously reported method16, which usually needs more than 10h of etching, our modified method avoids the tedious washing steps with no re-addition of CTAC, and the etching process could be easily completed within 30min possibly due to the increased CTAC concentration. Figure 1b shows the representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of as-prepared HMSN(CTAC) with oriented mesoporous shell structures. The surfactant CTAC was later removed via an extraction process by stirring HMSN(CTAC) in 1wt% solution of NaCl in methanol18. The pore size of HMSN was 2-3nm, similar to that of MSN as we reported previously13. The diameter of hollow space was ~100nm, and the thickness of MSN shell was measured to be ~25nm. Both hollow cavity and MSN shell thickness are readily tunable. For example, using smaller size dSiO2 (~50nm), which could be synthesized in a water-in-oil reverse microemulsion19, uniform HMSN with a smaller cavity inside (~50nm) and thinner MSN shell (~7.5nm) outside could also be synthesized (Figure S1).As proposed by Zheng et al., selective etching of dSiO2 core and redeposition of the soluble silicate species are both important steps during the formation of HMSN16. Cationic surfactants (in our case CTAC) play vital roles in such etching-redeposition mechanism16. During the etching process, positively charged cetyltrimethylammonium cations (CTA+) will first absorb to the surface of dSiO2@MSN(CTAC) via electronic attraction. Subsequently, with the presence of Na2CO3 in the solution and CTAC in the MSN shell, selective etching of silica from the dSiO2 core starts and will be accelerated by the surrounding free CTAC, forming uniform HMSN(CTAC) after the redeposition process.We also found that, to selectively etch out the dSiO2 core and leave the MSN shell intact, the CTAC concentration, etching temperature and etching time should be tightly-controlled. Only dSiO2 will be obtained, and all the MSN shell will be etched away if the concentration of CTAC was kept at below 6.25mg/mL (Figure S2a). Increasing the CTAC concentration up to 66.7mg/mL will result in uniform HMSN only when etching is done in a water bath with a mild temperature (i.e. 50C) for a relatively short time (e.g. 3060min), as shown in Figure S2b, c. Too high etching temperature (e.g. 80C) and too long etching time will easily cause over-etching of HMSN, leaving aggregated nanoparticles with highly rough surfaces (Figure S2d,e,f).Surface engineering plays a vital role in in vivo applications of nanoparticles, including HMSN. Figure 2 shows the major steps involved in the synthesis of multifunctional HMSN starting from hard template of dSiO2 (1). After the generation of uniform HMSN (3), the nanoparticles were surface modified with amino groups (-NH2) to obtain HMSN-NH2 (4) before further bio-conjugations. Small molecular anti-cancer drugs (e.g. doxorubicin hydrochloride [DOX]) could be loaded inside the hollow space, following by near-infrared (NIR) dye (i.e. ZW800) and 64Cu-chelator (i.e. 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-triacetic acid [NOTA]) conjugations, forming NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800 (5). Afterward, the nano-conjugate was PEGylated with SCM-PEG5k-Mal (Mal denotes maleimide) to render stability in aqueous biological buffers, forming NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-PEG-Mal (6). Afterward, thiolated anti-CD105 antibody (i.e. TRC105-SH) was conjugated to the nanoparticle to obtain NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 (7). Finally, PET isotope 64Cu with a half-life of 12.7h was used to label the nanoparticle, forming 64Cu-NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 (8, abbreviated as 64Cu-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-TRC105 for clarity consideration). In comparison with our previously reported surface modification method which starts with thiolated MSN13, nano-conjugates with much better stability could be obtained with only one PEGylation step using the current protocol. More importantly, it could be applied to the surface engineering of other silica-related nanoparticles. Since all the HMSN conjugates will contain the same NOTA and PEG chains (5kDa) that were covalently linked to HMSN, both NOTA and PEG were omitted from the acronyms of the final conjugates for clarity considerations.A representative TEM image of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 is shown in Figure 1c, where no obvious morphology change of HMSN could be observed after multi-step surface modification. The final nano-conjugate could be well-dispersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Average size of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 was found to be ~150nm, which is slightly smaller than the Z-average size (i.e. 194.4nm) measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Figure S3 also presents the size distribution of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105, acquired by DLS. Slightly negatively charged surface (5.1 0.9mV) of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 was also observed.Zwitterionic NIR fluorophore ZW800 (also named as ZW800-1) has recently been demonstrated as a better NIR dye (Ex = 745nm, Em = 800nm) for providing a significantly improved signal-to-background ratio during in vivo image-guided surgery, in comparison with traditional dyes such as Cy5.5 and IRDye800CW20. Therefore, ZW800-NHS ester was covalently conjugated to the outer surface of HMSN-NH2 to render the nanoparticle NIRF imaging capability. To avoid the possible dye-dye self-quenching, the optimal ratio between HMSN and ZW800 was carefully investigated (Figure 3). The lowest degree of ZW800 quenching (~4.8%) was observed when keeping the mole ratio as low as 1:2, where up to 81.4% conjugation efficiency was achieved with each HMSN covered by approximately 1.6 ZW800 dyes (Figure 3a, Table S1). Increasing the amount of dyes while keeping that of HMSN unchanged would increase the number of dye per HMSN to larger than 8, as shown in Table S1, however it also caused severe dye-dye quenching: About 74% and 92% degree of quenching were estimated when fixing the ratio to be 1:10 and 1:20, respectively (Figure 3b,c and Table S1). Therefore, the optimized ratio of 1:2 was used in the following in vivo tumor targeted imaging studies.In vitro CD105 targeting of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105Before the in vivo tumor targeted imaging, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, CD105 positive) and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (CD105 negative) were used for flow cytometry studies to confirm the in vitro CD105 targeting efficiency of the HMSN-ZW800-TRC105. Due to the lack of NIR excitation light source in BD FACSCalibur four-color analysis cytometer (equipped with 488 and 633nm lasers), NHS-fluorescein was conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles to facilitate such investigation. The flow cytometry results from Figure 4a indicated that incubation with fluorescein conjugated HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 (50nM, targeted group) could significantly enhance the mean fluorescence intensity of HUVECs, while treatment with fluorescein conjugated HMSN-ZW800 (50nM, non-targeted group), or fluorescein conjugated HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 with a blocking dose of TRC105 (500g/mL, blocking group), only gave minimal fluorescence enhancement. In contrast, incubating fluorescein conjugated HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 or fluorescein conjugated HMSN-ZW800 with MCF-7 cells only showed background fluorescence level for all groups (Figure 4b), demonstrating low non-specific binding of functionalized HMSN conjugates in CD105 negative cells. Taken together these findings, successful CD105 targeting of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 was demonstrated in vitro.In vivo tumor targeting and PET/NIRF dual-modality imagingPET is highly sensitive, quantitative, clinically relevant, and has excellent tissue penetration of signal21222324. Labeling nanoparticles with positron-emitting radionuclides has been generally recognized as the most accurate means for non-invasive evaluation of their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics25262728. For in vivo tumor targeted PET imaging, NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 was labeled with 64Cu and purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. The radioactivity fractions (typically elute between 3.0 and 4.0mL) were collected for further in vivo experiments. A typical size exclusion column chromatography profile is provided in Figure S4. Inset in Figure S4 also shows the PET and NIRF imaging of fraction 3.03.5mL, demonstrating the successful synthesis of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105.Since PET imaging detects the radioisotopes (e.g. 64Cu in this work) rather than the HMSN conjugates per se, excellent in vivo stability is a prerequisite for PET to truly reflect the in vivo distribution of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105. Serum stability study (Figure S5) of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 showed that over 99% of 64Cu remained intact within 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 over a 24h incubation period in whole mouse serum at 37C while shaking, which indicates high stability of as-synthesized 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105.In vivo tumor targeted PET imaging were then carried out in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice, which express high level of CD105 on the tumor neovasculature1415. Each mouse was injected with 510MBq of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105, and time points of 0.5, 4, 16, 24h p.i. were chosen for serial PET scans to show the in vivo biodistribution patterns of mice from targeting, non-targeting and blocking groups (Figure 5). Quantitative data obtained from region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of these PET images are also shown in Table S2S4.The accumulation of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 in the 4T1 tumor was found to be 8.5 1.1%ID/g at 0.5h p.i., and peaked at 9.9 0.9%ID/g at 4h p.i., as shown in Figure 5a,6a,S6 and Table S2 (n = 4). In contrast, without the conjugation of TRC105 (i.e. passive targeting alone), the 4T1 tumor uptake of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800 was found to be only one third of the targeted group at all of the time points examined (n = 4; Figure 5b, Table S3), indicating that TRC105 conjugation could be the controlling factor for enhanced tumor accumulation of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105. To further confirm CD105 targeting specificity of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 in vivo, blocking studies were also performed. Administration of a blocking dose (1mg/mouse) of free TRC105 at 1h before 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 injection could significantly reduce the tumor uptake to 4.1 1.7 and 5.5 2.2%ID/g at 0.5 and 4h p.i., respectively (n = 3, Figure 5c, Table S4), clearly demonstrating CD105 specificity of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 in vivo. Figure 6c also summarizes the comparison of 4T1 tumor uptake of 3 groups at different time points, where 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 shows the highest tumor uptake throughout the study period.Besides significantly improved tumor targeting efficacy, the tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios increased as well. As shown in Figure 6b, T/M value of the targeted group was estimated to be 9.0 1.7 at 0.5h p.i., and increased up to 13.7 0.6 at 4h p.i., which is significantly higher than that of non-targeting and blocking groups (Figure S7, Table S67). Similar as what we have observed previously with 64Cu-MSN-TRC10513, besides tumor accumulation, most of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 nano-conjugates were taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) with liver uptake found to be 27.8 1.6%ID/g at 0.5h p.i. and decreased gradually to 15.4 1.1%ID/g at 24h p.i. (n = 4; Figure 6a, Table S2), which was validated by the ex vivo biodistribution study (Figure 6d).Engineering of HMSN to integrate two or more imaging modalities into one nanosystem has become a recent trend, which could provide complementary and more accurate information about the pharmacokinetics of HMSN in vivo8. Generally speaking, optical imaging is inexpensive, widely available, and highly sensitive for superficial tissues, which has been extensively used for monitoring various molecular/biological events in cells and small animal models2930. Although various strategies (e.g. organic dye doping, fluorescent nanoparticle encapsulation, etc.) have been developed to engineer MSNs for optical imaging applications in vitro and in vivo31, very few reports about the engineering of HMSN for in vivo targeted optical imaging exist in the literature.With the presence of optimized number of ZW800 on the surface of each HMSN nano-conjugate, the in vivo NIRF imaging was also carried out. Each 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse was first shaved and injected with HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 with 800pmol of ZW800. Similar time points (i.e. 0.5, 4, 20, 24h p.i.) as that of PET imaging studies were chosen for serial optical imaging using the IVIS Spectrum system (Ex = 745nm, Em = 800nm). Figure 7 shows the in vivo NIRF images of mice from 3 groups. Significantly higher optical intensity of tumor (marked with red circle) from targeted group could be clearly seen (Figure 7ac), and was confirmed by the ex vivo imaging (Figure 7df, right lane). For all 3 groups, tumor signals decreased over time, possibly due to the wash-out of nano-conjugates in vivo. Ex vivo imaging of major organs, e.g. liver (Li), spleen (S), lung (Lu), kidney (K), heart (H) and tumor (T), showed similar distribution patterns as what has been shown in Figure 6d, with liver and spleen being the major nanoparticle uptake organs.Enhanced in vivo tumor targeted drug deliveryAlthough MSN has been considered as a drug delivery nano-platform for over 10 years1, it was not until recently that the first example of quantitative assessment of tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo enhanced drug delivery using TRC105 conjugated MSN(DOX) was demonstrated by our group13. In this work, we demonstrated that HMSN could become a more attractive nanocarrier for future drug delivery applications.In comparison with the DOX loading capacity in MSN (i.e. 71.6481.6mg/g), with the presence of hollow cavity inside HMSN, a significantly improved (about 315 times higher) drug loading capacity, up to 1129.2mg/g, was achieved (Figure S8a). The successful loading of DOX was further supported by the UV-vis absorbance spectra of HMSN(DOX), which exhibited the characteristic absorption peak at around 480nm (Figure 8a, red line). DOX is known to be intrinsically pH sensitive32. Due to the protonation of silanols (-Si-OH) in HMSN with the decrease of pH, electrostatic interaction between DOX and HMSN will be decreased, causing the dissociation of DOX from the silica surface and mesoporous channels. A pH-sensitive DOX release profile was also observed in HMSN(DOX), where shows a faster DOX release rate at acidic condition (pH 5.0) than that at neutral condition (pH 7.4, Figure 8b). Besides loading one type of hydrophilic anti-cancer drug, e.g. DOX, we also demonstrated here that HMSN could be a promising nanocarrier for loading certain hydrophobic drugs, such as Sunitilib (SUN, Figure S9), as well as double-loading with both SUN and DOX (Figure S10).As a proof-of-concept, we further demonstrated the feasibility of enhanced tumor targeted drug delivery in vivo using TRC105 conjugated HMSN(DOX), denoted as HMSN(DOX)-TRC105, after i.v. injection in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (HMSN dose: 10mg/kg, DOX dose: 6.5mg/kg). Half an hour after injection of HMSN(DOX)-(w/o)-TRC105 (w/o denotes with and without), the major organs were collected and imaged in the IVIS system (Ex = 465nm; Em = 580nm) to detect the presence of DOX, as shown in Figure 8c, d. It is important to note that due to different absorption/scattering behaviors of DOX in various tissues, optical signal intensities from different organs may not accurately reflect the absolute uptake level of injected HMSN(DOX)-(w/o)-TRC105. For example, although liver is the dominant organ for HMSN nano-conjugates accumulation, as evidenced in our PET/NIRF imaging and biodistribution studies (Figure 5, 6d, and 7), only weak optical signal could be observed based on ex vivo optical imaging because of its dark color and strong absorbance of visible DOX fluorescence (Figure 8d). In contrast, due to the much lighter color of tumor tissue, dominant optical signal from DOX could be observed in mice injected with HMSN(DOX)-TRC105, which is significantly stronger than the control group without TRC105 conjugation. Therefore, the significantly enhanced tumor targeting efficiency and drug (or multiple drugs) loading capacity will make antibody conjugated HMSN a highly attractive nano-platform for future cancer targeted imaging and therapy.DiscussionAlthough molecular imaging of functionalized HMSN using imaging techniques, such as MRI11, optical imaging10 and ultrasound7, has been reported previously8, to date most of the studies have been primarily focused on optimization of nanoparticle synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, no in vivo tumor active-targeted PET imaging, quantitative tumor uptake, and biodistribution studies of HMSN have been reported. By surface engineering of uniform HMSN with radioisotopes (i.e. 64Cu), NIR dyes (i.e. ZW800) and CD105 targeting antibodies (i.e. TRC105), we reported here the first example of in vivo tumor vasculature targeted PET/NIRF dual-modal imaging of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105. An average of 3-fold enhancement of tumor accumulation was achieved in targeted group when compared with the non-targeted group. The CD105 specific targeting was further confirmed with blocking studies both in vitro and in vivo. It is also worthy to mention that the highest 4T1 tumor uptake of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 (9.9 0.9%ID/g at 4h p.i., n = 4) was nearly 2 times higher than our previously reported 64Cu-MSN-TRC105 (5.9 0.4%ID/g at 5h p.i., n = 3)13, as shown in Figure S8b, resulting in remarkable enhancement in targeting efficacy as well as T/M ratio (13.7 0.6 at 4h p.i. vs 6.2 1.8 at 5h p.i.)13.Meanwhile, although tumor vasculature targeting has recently been demonstrated to be a versatile strategy for many well-functionalized nanomaterials regardless of tumor type28, the absolute level of tumor accumulation for most of the nanomaterials investigated to date is still relatively low, typically in the range of 36%ID/g13253334353637, significantly lower than that of liver uptake (usually 2030%ID/g or higher for most of the nanomaterials upon i.v. injection). To the best of our knowledge, 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 is one of the very few vasculature targeted nanoparticles (another sample is RGD peptide conjugated single-walled carbon nanotubes which target integrin v338) that could have about 10%ID/g of in vivo tumor uptake. Although we believe surface engineering of nanoparticles could play a vital role, elucidating the exact reasons behind such remarkably enhanced tumor uptake requires systematic side-by-side tumor uptake comparison of well-engineered HMSN with varied particle size, morphology, surface charge, antibody density, etc., which deserves comprehensive investigation in the future. Considering the presence of large drug reservoir (i.e. hollow space) inside each HMSN, TRC105 conjugated HMSN might become a highly attractive drug delivery platform for future cancer theranostics.In conclusion, we reported the engineering of uniform HMSN for remarkably enhanced in vivo tumor vasculature targeted PET/NIRF dual-modality imaging and enhanced drug delivery. Uniform and size-controllable HMSN was synthesized with a modified hard-templating method, which were subjected to a generally applicable surface engineering process, including amino groups functionalization, anti-cancer drug loading, NIR dye and NOTA linkages, PEGylation, antibody conjugation and radiolabeling, forming ~150nm sized mono-disperse 64Cu-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-TRC105 nano-conjugates. The optimal ratio between HMSN and ZW800 was also carefully investigated to avoid the self-quenching effect, and found to be 1:2 with less than 5% of quenching. Systematic in vitro and in vivo studies was performed to investigate the stability, targeting efficacy and specificity, biodistribution and drug delivery capability of well-modified HMSN nano-conjugates. Quantitative PET imaging study showed an over 3-fold higher of tumor uptake in the targeted group when compared with the non-targeted group, demonstrating that 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 is one of the very few vasculature targeting nanoparticles with high (~10%ID/g) tumor uptake. Furthermore, with the presence of hollow space inside HMSN, 315 times higher of DOX loading capacity has also been achieved when compared with MSN, with the highest loading capacity estimated to be 1129.2mg/g. In vivo enhanced DOX delivery was also demonstrated in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Take together these results, active tumor targeting and drug delivery of functionalized HMSN may pave the way for further in vivo targeted cancer therapeutic studies as well as potential clinical translational of this promising type of nano-platform, since silica is generally regarded as safe by the FDA.MethodsSynthesis of uniform HMSNUniform HMSN with an average particle size of 150nm was synthesized following the literature procedure with improved Na2CO3-etching process16. Three major steps were involved in the synthesis of HMSN. Firstly, synthesis of uniform ~100nm sized dSiO2 using a modified Stber method17. In a typical synthesis, 35.7mL of absolute ethanol was mixed with 5mL water and 0.8mL of ammonia and stirred for 510 minutes at room temperature. Then 1mL of TEOS was added and the mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 1h. Afterward, dSiO2 nanoparticles was washed with water and ethanol and suspended in 20mL of water.Secondly, synthesis of dSiO2@MSN. CTAC (2g) and TEA (20mg) were dissolved in 20mL of high Q water and stirred at room temperature for 1h. Then, 10mL of dSiO2 water solution was added and stirred at room temperature for 1h before addition of 0.15mL of TEOS. The mixture was stirred for 1h at 80C in a water bath to form dSiO2@MSN.Thirdly, etching of dSiO2@MSN to form HMSN. Both mixture and water bath were cooled down to 50C followed by addition of 636mg of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which was under constant stirring for 30min to form HMSN. To remove the CTAC, the product was extracted for 24h with a 1wt% solution of NaCl in methanol at room temperature. This process was carried out for at least 3 times to ensure complete removal of CTAC.Synthesis of HMSN-NH2To functionalize the HMSN surface with NH2 groups, as-synthesized HMSN was first dispersed in 20mL of absolute ethanol, followed by addition of 1mL of APS. The system was sealed and kept at 8690C in a water bath for 24h. Afterward, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with ethanol for several times to remove the residual APS. The HMSN-NH2 could be well-dispersed in water, and the concentration of NH2 groups (nmol/mL) was measured using a Kaiser test kit.Synthesis of NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG-TRC105To conjugated HMSN with ZW800, 2nmol of ZW800 was mixed with HMSN-NH2 (with ~100nmol of -NH2 groups), and reacted for 2h at room temperature (pH 8.59.0) to form HMSN-ZW800. Then, p-SCN-Bn-NOTA (~53nmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide was allowed to react with HMSN-NH2 at pH 8.5 to obtain NOTA-HMSN-ZW800. Afterward, 2mg (400nmol) of SCM-PEG5k-Mal was added and reacted for another 1h, resulting in NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG-Mal. NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 could be obtained by reacting TRC105-SH (2.5nmol, 50nmol/mL) with NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG-Mal (0.5nmol, 2nmol/mL).64Cu labeling and serum stability studies64CuCl2 (~148MBq) was diluted in 300L of 0.1M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and added to NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 or NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37C for 30min with constant shaking. 64Cu-NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 and 64Cu-NOTA-HMSN-ZW800-PEG were purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. The radioactivity fractions (typically between 3.0 and 4.0mL, total of 1mL) were collected for further in vivo PET imaging experiments. After 6mL of PBS, the unreacted 64Cu may start to elute from the column. The whole procedure of 64Cu labeling and purification of the HMSN nano-conjugates could be completed within 60min.For serum stability studies, 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 was incubated in whole mouse serum at 37C for up to 24h (the time period investigated for serial PET imaging, which is about two half-lives of 64Cu). Portions of the mixture were sampled at different time points and filtered through 10kDa cutoff filters. The filtrates were collected, and the radioactivity was measured. The percentages of retained (i.e. intact) 64Cu on the HMSN-PEG conjugates (64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105) were calculated using the equation [(total radioactivity - radioactivity in filtrate)/total radioactivity] 100%.PET/NIRF imaging and biodistribution studiesAll animal studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. PET and PET/CT scans at various time points p.i. using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical SolutionsUSA, Inc.), image reconstruction, and ROI analysis of the PET data were performed similar as described previously343539404142. Quantitative PET data were presented as %ID/g. Tumor-bearing mice were each injected with 510MBq of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 or 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800 via tail vein before serial PET scans. Another group of three 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were each injected with 1mg of unlabeled TRC105 at 1h before 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 administration to evaluate the CD105 targeting specificity of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 in vivo (i.e. blocking experiment).After the last PET scans at 24h p.i., biodistribution studies were carried out to confirm that the %ID/g values based on PET imaging accurately represented the radioactivity distribution in tumor-bearing mice. The radioactivity in the tissue was measured using a gamma-counter (Perkin-Elmer) and presented as %ID/g (mean SD).For in vivo NIRF imaging, each 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse was injected with 0.5nmol of HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 (targeted group) with the amount of ZW800 estimated to be ~800pmol. The mouse was then imaged using an IVIS Imaging System (Ex = 745nm, Em = 800nm) at different time points. At 24h p.i., mouse was sacrificed for ex vivo NIRF imaging. For non-targeting and blocking groups, mice were injected with the same amount of HMSN-ZW800 and HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 (together with 1mg blocking dose of free TRC105), respectively.In vivo enhanced drug deliveryHMSN(DOX)-TRC105 was first prepared. Typically, 0.4mg of HMSN-NH2 was first loaded with DOX, and then went through same PEGylation and TRC105 conjugation, as described previously. For in vivo enhanced drug delivery study, 4T1 tumor bearing mice were i.v. injected with HMSN(DOX)-TRC105 (targeted group: 10mg HMSN/kg, 6.5mg DOX/kg), and HMSN(DOX) (non-targeted group: 10mg HMSN/kg, 6.5mg DOX/kg). The mice were than sacrificed at 0.5h p.i. for ex vivo optical imaging in the IVIS system (Ex = 465nm, Em = 580nm).Author ContributionsF.C., H.H. and W.C. conceived of the study and wrote the manuscript.

Upper left right: a scheme and TEM image of single HMSN-ZW800-TRC105.Figure 2Surface engineering of HMSN.Uniform dense silica (dSiO2, 1) was firstly synthesized and coated with a shell of MSN, forming dSiO2@MSN (2). Tightly-controlled Na2CO3 etching step was introduced to selectively etch dSiO2 away, leaving uniform HMSN (3). As-synthesized HMSN was then surface modified with (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APS) to form amino groups conjugated HMSN-NH2 (4) before further bio-conjugations. Anti-cancer drugs (i.e. DOX) were then loaded, followed by NIR dye (i.e. ZW800) and 64Cu chelator (i.e. NOTA) conjugations, forming NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800 (5). Afterward, nano-conjugate was PEGylated with SCM-PEG5k-Mal to render its stability in biological buffers (e.g. PBS), forming NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-PEG-Mal (6). Then, thiolated anti-CD105 antibody (i.e. TRC105-SH) was conjugated to the nanoparticle to obtain NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 (7). Lastly, PET isotope 64Cu (t1/2 = 12.7h) was used to label the nanoparticle, forming 64Cu-NOTA-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-PEG-TRC105 (8).Figure 3Dye-dye self-quenching study.The molar ratio of HMSN to ZW800 was fixed to be (a) 1:2, (b) 1:10, (c) 1:20.

Laser-synthesized Au nanoparticles (AuNP) present a viable alternative to chemical counterparts and can offer exceptional purity (no trace of contaminants) and unusual surface chemistry making possible direct conjugation with biocompatible polymers (dextran, polyethylene glycol). This work presents the first pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and safety study of laser-ablated dextran-coated AuNP (AuNPd) under intravenous administration in small animal model. Our data show that AuNPd are rapidly eliminated from the blood circulation and accumulated preferentially in liver and spleen, without inducing liver or kidney toxicity, as confirmed by the plasmatic ALAT and ASAT activities, and creatininemia values. Despite certain residual accumulation in tissues, we did not detect any sign of histological damage or inflammation in tissues, while IL-6 level confirmed the absence of any chronic inflammation. The safety of AuNPd was confirmed by healthy behavior of animals and the absence of acute and chronic toxicities in liver, spleen and kidneys. Our results demonstrate that laser-synthesized AuNP are safe for biological systems, which promises their successful biomedical applications.Subject termsNanotechnology in cancerMethods of toxicology studiesissue-copyright-statement The Author(s) 2019IntroductionGold (Au) is one of very important elements of the periodic table, known by both luxury qualities and unique physical, physico-chemical and chemical characteristics. The reduction of size of gold down to the nanoscale leads to novel astonishing properties such as prominent catalytic1,2 and electrocatalytic3,4 responses, a variety of plasmonic effects associated with optical excitation of collective free electron oscillations (surface plasmons), including strong resonant extinction5, drastic field enhancement6, optical manipulations beyond the diffraction limit7, ultrasensitive biosensing8, etc. On the other hand, gold is highly biocompatible9,10, which promises successful biomedical applications of Au nanoparticles (AuNP) profiting from plasmonic or other effects11. Oncology looks as one of most promising application areas, as after an appropriate functionalization AuNP can be targeted to the tumor (actively or passively), accumulated in cancer cells and then be used either as contrast agents in cancer imaging or sensitizers of different local therapies under external stimuli. As an example, extremely efficient optical absorption, with typically ~105-fold higher cross section than absorbing dyes, has been used in a number of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including light induced hyperthermia-based therapy1214, confocal reflectance microscopy15, photoacoustic tomography16, optical coherence tomography17 imaging modalities. For these optical modalities, Au nanostructures should have their absorption/scattering feature within the tissue transparency window between about 700 and 1000nm, which can be satisfied by employing designed plasmonic structures (SiO2-Au or Si-Au core-shells, Au nanorods). As another prominent example, relatively small (520nm) AuNP can serve as contrast agents in X-ray radiation imaging18,19 and as sensitizers of radiation therapies2022.Such biomedical applications require the choice of minimally toxic Au-based nanomaterials to enable such imaging or therapeutic functionalities. The toxicity of Au nanostructures depends on size and shape (spherical, nanorods, nanostars, etc) characteristics, as well as surface conditioning and chemistry, including the presence of toxic contaminants, surface charge and stabilization coatings2326. Conventional methods for the synthesis of colloidal Au nanostructures (nanoparticles, nanorods, core-shells) are based on colloidal chemistry, including reverse micelles or the reduction of a gold precursor in the presence of capping agents.1315,2730, but these methods cannot provide optimal parameters for biomedical applications. First, these methods typically cause surface contamination by residual by-products, ligands and reducing agents, which can cause toxicity issues3133. Second, in many cases chemically-synthesized AuNP are positively charged or stabilized by cationic surfactants, which can provoke their undesirable interactions with negatively charged DNAs3436. Third, the stabilization of chemically-synthesized AuNP and advanced structures (nanorods, nanocages, nanostars etc.) typically requires surfactants and protecting ligands that can lead to severe toxicity effects. As an example, the stabilization of nanorods is based on the use of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)25,26, which causes unexpectedly high toxicity24,37. The biocompatibility of chemically-synthesized Au nanostructures can be much improved by their coating by polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), and polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA)23,24, but such coating cannot completely protect from the release of toxic agents after a long-term exposure of AuNP-polymer complexes in vivo. The evolution of AuNP in biological systems, including efficiency of cellular uptake, biodistribution etc., is finally highly affected by a protein corona (layer of proteins that adsorb on the nanoparticles in biological environments), but the composition of this corona is also strongly affected by initial surface conditioning and coatings2325. In general, spherical nanoparticles with the size around 1550nm look less toxic, provided they do not contain toxic contaminants and are properly coated2326.Laser-ablative synthesis was recently introduced as a green physical alternative to conventional chemical pathways, which offers quite different surface conditioning and chemistry, as well as an exceptional level of material purity3841. Such a synthesis profits from natural generation of nanoclusters under ablation of a solid target by laser radiation in liquid ambient42. The nanoclusters then coalesce in the liquid to form colloidal nanoparticle solution. Since this method does not depend on the presence of specific chemical products (e.g., gold salts) during the synthesis, it can avoid any contamination of nanoparticle surface, while the use of ultrashort (femtosecond) laser ablation enables to finely control size and structural characteristics of formed AuNP40,41,4345. It is also important that laser-synthetized AuNP exhibit unusual surface chemistry based on the presence of gold oxide states, which conditions O termination when pH 546. Such a surface chemistry, hardly reproducible with chemical synthesis pathways, makes possible hydrogen bonding interactions of AuNP with a variety of biocompatible molecules containing OH groups, including oligosaccharides46,47, biopolymers (polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextrans)48, proteins49 and oligonucleotides50. The one-step conjugation with polymers or other molecules (no intermediate group is required) presents an interesting new option, which could give some advantages for biological applications. In addition, laser-ablated AuNP (bare or polymer-coated) are typically negatively charged, which promises the absence of toxic effects related to DNA damage.Ultrapure AuNP prepared by laser ablation could be considered as new appealing candidate for biomedical applications, but there are only a few data describing their interaction with biological systems. Studying the interaction of laser-synthesized AuNP with rat pancreatic tumour cells, Goldys et al.51, reported their non-toxicity and a size-dependent cellular uptake. Barcikowski et al. showed that the functionalization of laser-produced AuNP with some peptides52 and polymers53 can improve cell uptake. We recently studied cytotoxicity and cell uptake of three types of Au nanoparticles: bare (ligand-free) AuNP, dextran-coated AuNP and PEG-coated AuNP54. Cell viability profiles demonstrated that AuNP did not induce major inhibition of cell survival until concentrations of 100g/mL, indicating a satisfactory low toxic effect, while all type of AuNP demonstrated a good cellular uptake. By examining the interaction of bare, dextran- and PEG-coated AuNP with living cells, for the first time we determined the composition of the protein corona covering the nanoparticles in biological environment. Such a corona appeared after 30seconds of AuNP exposition and contained a variety of proteins, including apolipoproteins, which are implicated in intracellular transport and crossing of biological barriers, while the presence of immune proteins (complement C3) was lower for polymer-coated AuNP compared to bare ones, suggesting their better transport properties.This study is conceived as the first attempt to assess the interaction of dextran polymer-coated laser-synthesized AuNP with biological systems in vivo. Using intravenous administration of AuNPd in mouse model, we examine toxicity, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of these nanoparticles. We show that despite certain residual accumulation in organs of reticuloendothelial system, laser-synthesized AuNPd look safe and do not provoke any sign of toxic effects.ResultsSynthesis and characterization of dextran-coated Au nanoparticlesFor fabrication of AuNP, we used a technique of fs laser ablation in aqueous solutions, which was developed in our previous studies4648. A gold target was placed on the bottom of a glass vessel filled with an aqueous solution of dextran (1mg/mL) and ablated by radiation from a femtosecond Yb:KGW laser (see details in Methods section), as shown in Fig.1A. The ablation process led to the production of colloidal dispersions of AuNP, which was accompanied by a characteristic red coloration of solutions. The formed solutions exhibited a characteristic peak around 520nm in the extinction spectra, which is associated with the excitation of surface plasmons over gold NP. As we showed in our earlier studies4648,54, Au nanoparticles prepared by the technique of femtosecond laser ablation in aqueous solutions exhibit exceptionally high stability (they are stable for several years while keeping at room temperature) due to electrical repulsion effect resulting from strong negative charging of nanoparticles. In our case, AuNPd were also very stable, as we did not see any sign of agglomeration or precipitation after several months of storage in glass vials. According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and size distribution analysis (Fig.1B), particles prepared in dextran solution had the mean size of 21nm and size dispersion less than 10nm full-width-at-half maximum. As we earlier showed54, hydrodynamic diameter of such dextran-coated AuNPd is about 46nm, which is consistent with the formation of Au nanoparticle dextran complexes.Figure 1(A) Schematics of laser ablation setup. A laser beam is focused on the surface of the Au target, which is placed in the vessel filled with an aqueous solution of dextran. (B) Typical transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) image and corresponding size distribution of AuNP synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in aqueous solution of dextran.Effects of AuNPd on body weightThree groups of six mice were administered with a single intravenous dose of 1mg/kg of AuNPd and the control group was injected with vehicle alone. To investigate potential toxic effects due to NP, body weight and mice behavior were monitored after AuNPd administration. All animals showed a healthy appearance and normal activity without lethargy or apathy after NP administration. During the first 14 days after subcutaneous tumor grafting, as well as during the 14 days following AuNPd injection, the body weight of the mice injected with NP slightly increased in a pattern similar to the control mice, suggesting a normal mice growth in the absence of any significant toxic effect (Fig.2). Three mice of each group were placed in metabolic cages 24h before the sacrifice (which occurs 24h, 7 days or 14 days after AuNP administration), to monitor their food and water consumption and to collect urines for further determination of gold content. We did not observe any difference in water intake or food consumption between treated and control groups.Figure 2Evolution of the mean body weight of control mice or mice exposed to 1mg/kg AuNPd. Mice were weighted twice a week throughout the 28 days of the follow-up experiment; data represent the meanSEM of 6 mice.Pharmacokinetic analysisTo determine pharmacokinetic profile of AuNPd in blood, seven groups of five athymic nude female mice were treated with AuNPd at a unique dose of 1mg/kg by IV injection. Gold concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) 5min, 15min, 30min, 45min, 60min, 4h and 24h after AuNPd injection. To prevent underestimation of gold concentration that could be due to an incomplete mineralization of nanoparticulate gold, solutions were dosed with calibration curves carried out with ionic gold standard solutions and gold nanoparticles standard solutions. No significant differences were noted whatever the standard solutions used, confirming validity of the measurement (data not shown). AuNPd blood concentration-time curve with a semilogarithmic scale evidenced a rapid drop in initial concentration, followed by more gradual decline fitting into a classical bi-compartmental pharmacokinetic model characterized by a fast initial distribution phase followed by a terminal elimination phase with slower rate (Fig.3). Mean pharmacokinetic parameters, calculated using bi-compartmental analysis are summarized in Table1. One hour after injection, more than 95% of the injected dose was eliminated from the blood circulation, which is consistent with the low value of T1/2 (half-life for the distribution phase). T1/2 is the time required for the blood level of AuNPd to decrease by 50% of its initial value. Gold was undetectable in blood 24h post-administration, thus explaining the short T1/2 (half-life for elimination) and the high clearance value. The Vd parameter that reflects the degree of how a foreign material is distributed in organs and tissues, was well below the volume of the mice body fluid (2ml), which meant that AuNPd accumulated in the organs. All together, these data suggest that the amount of AuNPd in the central compartment (blood) declines rapidly due to the transfer of NP to the peripheral compartment (tissues) and/or to AuNPd elimination that occurs simultaneously.Figure 3Pharmacokinetic profile of AuNPd (1mg/kg) at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60min and 4h after a single intravenous administration (n=5, data are meanSEM). A point for 0minute corresponds to theoretical administered concentration (10 000ng/ml).Table 1Pharmacokinetic parameters of AuNPd.AuNPdT1/2 (biodistribution half-life)4.2minT1/2 (elimination half-life)307.7minAUC (area under the curve)4.7g.min.mL1Cmax0.3g.mL1Cl (Clearance)8.4mL.min1Vd (Volume of distribution)1.2LTissue biodistribution of AuNPdPharmacokinetic parameters indicate a rapid clearance of AuNPd from the bloodstream. To determine the distribution of AuNPd in tissues, three groups of six mice were administered with 1mg/kg of AuNPd and sacrificed at different times after injection: 24h, 7 and 14 days. The control group was injected with vehicle alone and sacrificed at day 14. Gold concentration in various tissues, including liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung and brain, was measured by ICP-MS and expressed as ng/mg organ. Twenty-four hours after injection, spleen and liver were preferential sites for gold accumulation with 8.784.33ng/mg and 6.363.37ng/mg (Fig.4A et4B), respectively. However, considering size of the organs, AuNPd accumulated mostly in liver, in which Au concentration was more than 35% of the injected dose after 24h and more than 50% after one and two weeks (Table2). In other organs and in tumor, gold concentrations were much lower with less than 0.15ng/mg of tissue at 14 days. The lowest concentration was found in the brain with less than 0.03ng/mg. Moreover, no statistical difference was found between gold concentrations at different time point in lungs, heart, brain and urine. In addition, AuNPd were not cleared by kidney because less than 0.1% of injected dose was found in urine (Fig.4C). All together, our results indicate that AuNPd accumulated mostly in the liver, without obvious decrease for 14 days.Figure 4Gold concentration measured by ICP-MS 24h, 7 days and 14 days after a single injection of AuNPd (1mg/kg).

No evidence of atrophy, hyperplasia, necrosis or inflammation was observed. To further explore for abnormalities, histological examination of tissues was performed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Liver examination did not evidence any negative effects in animals injected with AuNPd compared to control group. The microscopic parenchymal architecture evidenced normal hepatocytes without any signs of steatosis, inflammation nor fibrosis. Similarly, microscopic observation of kidney, spleen and heart did not reveal any sign of inflammation or fibrosis (Fig.5).Figure 5Histological section of mice liver, kidney, spleen and heart, 24h, 7 and 14 days after intravenous administration of AuNPd (1mg/kg) compared to the control group administered with vehicle alone. All sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin.Uptake and subcellular localization of AuNPd in hepatic and splenic tissuesBiodistribution data have shown that AuNPd preferentially accumulated in liver and spleen. Therefore, we decided to assess subcellular localization of AuNPd in these organs by TEM at 24h, 7 and 14 days after injection. A control group administered with vehicle alone was used. While gold is a dense-electron material, nanoparticles were easily detected on organ slides. AuNPd were observed in liver and spleen in all animals that receive AuNPd injection, and representative images are shown in Fig.6. AuNPd were present inside phagocytosing cells of both liver (Kupffer cells) and spleen (macrophages). No AuNPd was detected in other liver cells like hepatocytes or endothelial cells nor in lymphocytes and red blood cells in spleen. Although some AuNPd were found isolated in Kuppfer cells and macrophages (data not shown), AuNPd preferentially agglomerated in cluster (containing more than 10 particles). Isolated AuNPd or AuNPd clusters were localized in endolysosomal compartments. No AuNPd were detected in cytosol, nucleus or in other cytoplasmic organelles. No differences in terms of AuNPd quantity and subcellular localization were observed between 24h, 7 and 14 days post-injection. Kupffer cells and macrophages of control animals did not contain any AuNPd. In addition, no morphological changes such as chromatin condensation or mitochondrial morphology were detected in hepatic and splenic tissues of AuNPd injected animals compared to control mice. All together, our results show that AuNPd accumulate in endolysosomes without inducing cellular toxicity (Fig.6).Figure 6Representative TEM micrographs of Kupffer cells in liver and macrophages in spleen of mice 24h, 7 and 14 days after intravenous injection of AuNPd (1mg/kg) compared to the control group administered with vehicle alone. Magnified views of the square area show endolysosomal compartment containing clustered AuNPd in treated animals.Biochemical and inflammation parameters after AuNPd injectionFinally, we investigated whether the treatment with AuNPd could modify the levels of biochemical tissue damage or inflammatory markers in plasma. To determine if AuNPd induced liver toxicity, we measured plasma ASAT (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALAT (Alanine Aminotransferase). An increase of these enzymes is considered as a key marker of hepatocellular injury. ALAT and ASAT levels remained normal in AuNPd treated animals for 14 days as compared to the control group with a mean value around 183U/L and 35U/L for ASAT and ALAT, respectively (Fig.7A). These results, combined with histological analysis, indicate that even if AuNPd accumulate in liver, they do not alter hepatic functions. Kidney function was assessed by measuring creatinine plasma level. We did not observe any significant difference between the AuNPd treated groups sacrificed at 24h and 14 days and the control group. However, the group sacrificed 7 days after AuNPd injection demonstrated a slight but statistically significant increase in creatinine level as compared to control group from 10.920.51 to 13.020.61 mol/L (p=0.026) (Fig.7B). Importantly, these values remain under the toxicity threshold and are consistent with the literature (1530 mol/L)5557. Moreover, the increase in creatinine was transitory and go back to normal value one week later, suggesting the absence of kidney dysfunction. Combined together, these results give evidence that AuNPd accumulation in liver and their small amount in kidney do not affect organ functionality.Figure 7ALAT and ASAT values (A), creatinine level (B) and IL-6 concentration (C) in mouse plasma 24h, 7 or 14 days after AuNPd injection (1mg/kg) or 14 days after vehicle injection for the control group. Data represent the meanSEM of 6 mice and statistical significance was determined by Students t-test (*p0.05).The potential inflammatory effect of AuNPd was determined by plasma level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a well-recognized mediator of inflammation. In control group, the average level of IL-6 was around 30pg/ml as described in literature56. Comparing to the control group, IL-6 level was not significantly modified at 24h, 7 days and 14 days post-treatment (Fig.7C). These results confirmed that a unique intravenous injection of 1mg/kg AuNPd was safe and did not induce acute and chronic toxicity.DiscussionThis study focused on the in vivo pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity of AuNP synthetized by ablation laser in dextran solution, following a bolus intravenous administration to subcutaneous tumor grafted mice. The healthy behaviour of animals, as well as the absence of acute and chronic toxicity on kidney, spleen and liver, confirm the safety of AuNPd previously described in vitro54. Pharmacokinetic data have shown that AuNPd were promptly cleared from the bloodstream and accumulated preferentially in liver and spleen. Small quantities of gold were also present in kidney, lung, heart and brain. Our results are consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile described in the literature for AuNPd not coated with PEG58. Indeed, liver has largely been described as a key organ for nanoparticles accumulation (predominantly inside Kupffer cells) after the intravenous administration59. Form, size, charges and density of Au-NP modulate tissue distribution60. In a study on tissue distribution of spherical AuNPd in rat, Jong et al., show that large AuNPd (diameter between 50 and 200nm) almost solely distributed in the blood, liver and spleen whereas smaller AuNPd (10nm diameter) were largely distributed61. In our study, gold content in liver and spleen did not decreased over time, suggesting a poor clearing efficacy through the bile ducts. A very low amount of AuNPd (0.23% of the injected dose) was found in kidney 7 days after administration. The decrease in gold content in kidney measured at day 14 as compared with day 7 may be explained by the clearance in urine (0.03ng/mL) of the smaller AuNPd (8nm) due to the physical size of glomerular filtration62. Because AuNPd predominantly accumulated in the liver, spleen and kidney, measurements of biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis were performed to deeply investigate their safety/toxicity risk for principal organs. Since plasma ALAT, ASAT activities and creatinine level remained almost unchanged and comparable to the parameters of the control mice group, one can conclude that the accumulation of AuNPd did not provoke any hepatic or renal toxicity. Furthermore, we detect no sign of histological damage such as fibrosis or inflammation in tissue. Lastly, the absence of chronic inflammation was supported by plasma IL-6 level that remains normal for 14 days after the AuNPd administration.Since non-specific uptake of nanoparticles can occur in populations of phagocytic cells and dense capillary beds present in non-target organs, we also quantified gold in cardiac and pulmonary tissues. Very low concentrations of gold were observed in these organs, thus confirming a good tolerability of AuNPd. In accordance with previous data26, less than 1% of gold was detectable in brain. The smaller size of NP may have crossed the blood brain barrier (BBB) through the 20nm space between astrocytic end-feet basement membrane and capillary endothelium63. Alternatively, adsorption of apolipoproteins on gold NPd observed in our previous study54 could have further facilitated brain transport through interaction of apolipoprotein with the scavenger receptor class B type located at the BBB64. Moreover, surfactants coated at the surface of nanoparticles may improve anticancer drug accumulation in brain tumors65. Importantly, no cognitive or compartmental abnormal sign was detected in living animals, suggesting that AuNPd can be useful for brain tumor treatment as drug delivery vector or photothermotherapy after optimizing brain uptake. Work is in progress in this direction to improve brain targeting by BBB opening using ultrasound. Focused ultrasound mediated-BBB opening is a non-invasive technique where ultrasounds are used to temporarily open the BBB in highly targeted areas of the brain66.Accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor by a passive targeting way is in competition with the internalization and clearance from blood by phagocytic cells and macrophages67. In addition, nanoparticles are supposed to be small enough to reach the tumor through transvascular pores and fenestrations for efficient EPR effect. Here, gold was not detectable in tumor, which is consistent with the short blood half-life. Indeed, previous reports have shown that an increase in plasma half-life resulted in greater accumulation in the tumor67. However, the most efficient passive tumor targeting with AuNP remain lower than 8% of the injected dose per gram of tissue68. Moreover, Jinbin Liu et al., described a GS-AuNP with rapid clearance in normal tissue, long retention in tumors, and high tumor targeting specificity but less than 5% AuNP per gram of tissue in tumor was observed at 12h post injection69. In order to increase AuNPd accumulation in tumor, the quantity of dextran at the surface of AuNPd should be increased or another surfactant such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) could be used. PEG has been previously shown to protect NP against opsonization and induce an increase in blood circulation time and enhanced tumor accumulation70. Alternatively, less negative zeta potential could increase the blood circulation time. Indeed, Arvizo et al. has found that neutral and zwitterionic AuNPd had a longer blood circulation time while negatively and positively charged AuNP had a relatively short blood half-lives71.In general, the level of toxicity we observed appears to be very low compared to previous studies on the use of chemically-prepared NP2325. It should be noted that the observed residual accumulation of gold in the organism was mentioned in almost all previous studies23,24,71. Nevertheless, our data show that the accumulation of laser-synthesized AuNP does not cause any acute or chronic toxicity, as it can take place with alternative Au-based counterparts or many other nanomaterials. As an example, residual accumulation of silica (SiO2) nanoparticles in liver under similar conditions induced mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate at the portal area and hepatocyte necrosis at the portal triads 7 days after injection72, as well the elevation in ASAT level and a larger number of sinusoidal Kupffer cells 48h after intravenous administration of rats55,72,73. We suppose that Au nanoparticles could be completely eliminated from the organism if their size is within renal glomerular filtration range (8nm)62. It is important that laser-ablation technology makes possible the fabrication of both bare and polymer-coated AuNP within this range4648. Interestingly, we recently carried our similar study of safety and biodistribution of laser-synthesized Si nanoparticles56,74, which present another promising material for imaging and therapy applications in biomedicine75, but in contrast to Au nanostructures76Si nanoparticles are biodegradable56,77,78. Our experiments also evidenced preferable accumulation of bare (uncoated) Si NP in liver and spleen under their intravenous administration, but such an accumulation did not cause any toxicity effects56,78. In addition, in contrast to gold nanostructures Si NP were rapidly biodegraded in the organism and completely eliminated 46 days following their injection56.ConclusionsFor the first time we studied safety, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of laser-synthesized dextran-coated AuNP under intravenous administration in small animal model. We found that AuNP were mostly accumulated in liver and spleen, but did not result in any hepatic or renal toxicity, as was indicated by stability of biochemical parameters and histological examination of tissues. The safety of AuNPd was confirmed by healthy behavior of animals and the absence of acute and chronic toxicities in key organs. In general, despite residual accumulation in tissues, laser-synthesized nanoparticles present a safe and very promising object for biomedical applications and can be used us drug carriers, contrast agents or sensitizers of therapies.MethodsSynthesis of Au nanoparticlesFor the fabrication of dextran-coated Au nanoparticles, we used a Yb:KGW laser (Amplitude Systems, 1025nm, 480fs, 100200 J per pulse, 1100kHz). The laser beam was focused onto the surface of s gold target (99.99%, GoodFellow, Lille, France) placed on the glass vessel bottom filled with 7ml of deionized water containing 1mg/mL of dextran (MW ~40,000, Sigma-Aldrich). To avoid the formation of craters leading to the decrease of ablation efficiency, the target was moved at a speed of 0.5mm/s during the experiment. To measure concentration of formed nanoparticles, we measured weight of the ablated target before and after laser ablation process.Characterization of nanoparticlesWe used a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy system (JEOL JEM 3010) to assess structural characteristics of formed nanoparticles. To prepare samples, we dropped a droplet (about 5L) of AuNP solution onto a carbon-coated TEM copper grid and dried it at ambient conditions. To examine extinction spectra, we used a UVVIS spectrophotometer (UV2600, Shimadzu).In vivo study designAll experimental protocols and animal analyses were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the French Government and the Regional Committee for Ethics on Animal Experiments (authorization number 0100903). The experimental procedure was approved by the Committee for Ethics on Animal Experiments of the Institute of NeuroPhysiopathology. For the biodistribution study, 24 athymic nude female mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu) (Harlan, France) aged 6 weeks were randomly divided in 4 groups. Mice were housed in cages, located in a well-ventilated, temperature-controlled room 212C with relative humidity ranging from 40% to 60%, and a light/dark period of 12h, with free access to water and food. On day 0, 2.5106 U87-MG human glioblastoma cells were administered subcutaneously on the left flank of all mice. Tumor growth and body weight were monitored twice a week. On day 14, when tumor measured approximately 100mm3, 3 groups of 6 mice were intravenously administered in tail vein with a single dose of 1mg/kg dextran-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPd) diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), corresponding to the maximal volume that can be administered intravenously. Control mice were injected through the tail vein only with PBS. After AuNPd administration, mice body weight and behaviour were monitored to detect a possible toxic effect of NPs. Animals were sacrificed at different times after AuNPd injection: 24h, 7 days and 14 days. Twenty-four hours before sacrifice, three mice per group were housed individually in metabolic cages to recover urine. Mice were then anesthetized with a solution of ketamine (0.75mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (0.10mg/kg body weight), and exsanguinated by cannulating the posterior aorta. The liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, tumor were removed and processed for histological and electron microscopy analysis as described below. Samples dedicated to gold determination were frozen and stored at 20C before analysis. The organs of 3 mice per group were used for gold determination and histological analysis. The organs of the 3 other mice were used for electron microscopy analysis.For the pharmacokinetic study, 35 athymic nude female mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu) (Harlan, France) aged 6 weeks were used and randomly divided in 7 groups. Mice were administered intravenously with the maximal dose of 1mg/kg AuNPd. Animals were sacrificed at different time points: 5min, 15min, 30min, 45min, 60min, 4h and 24h after AuNPd injection and blood samples (800L) were collected by intra-cardiac puncture. Samples dedicated to gold determination were frozen and stored at 20C before analysis.Gold determination contentBiological samples including liver, spleen, lung, kidney, heart, brain, tumor, were cut in small pieces and mineralized with nitric acid (3M) / hydrochloric acid (1M) and incubated at 100C during 8h. Liquid samples including whole blood and urine were mineralized by addition of 1ml of acid solution. Mineralized pellets were then diluted in deionized water and analyzed by ICP-MS using a Thermo Series II ICP-MS apparatus (Thermo-Electron, Les Ulis, France) to determine Au concentration. Standard calibration curve was performed with a solution of ionic gold and a solution of AuNP. (Quantification threshold was fixed at 0.01ng/mg for tissues and 0.006ng/L for urine and blood).Biochemical analysisBlood samples were collected by intra-cardiac puncture; plasmas were prepared by two successive centrifugations at 382g (2000 rpm) for 20minutes. Samples were stored at 20C until analysis by Institut clinique de la souris; Illkirch-Graffenstaden. ALAT (Alanine AminoTransferase), ASAT (Aspartate AminoTransferase) and creatinine plasmatic levels were quantified using AU400 Chemistry Analyzer, Beckman Coulter. Interleukin-6 plasmatic level was quantified by immunoassay using Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel (IL-6) (Millipore, MCYTOMAG-70k).Histological analysisOrgans were carefully collected, fixed and conserved in formalin solution before paraffin-embedding. Three-m-thick paraffin sections of different organs were then processed manually. Slides were deparaffinized in three successive baths of xylene (Hydroclear) for 10min and then rehydrated twice with 100% ethanol. After rising in tap water for 10min, slides were stained with Grndwald Hematoxylin for 30s. After washing, slides were stained with eosin for 15s and rapidly rinsed in tap water. Three baths of 100% ethanol were realized, and slides were stained in alcoholic safran solution for 30seconds. Slides were then cleared in xylene three times and mounted with Eukitt medium. The stained slides were scanned on a whole slide scanner (Nanozoomer 2.0-HT, Hamamatsu, Japan) at40 magnification, obtained images were opened using NP-Viewer software.Transmission electron microscopy studies of biological samplesFor TEM, samples were processed as followed. Three mice per group were perfused with 2.0% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% EM grade glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Organs were then carefully collected and cut into 1mm3 cubes in perfusion solution under binocular loupe. Samples were then fixed in 2.0% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% EM grade glutaraldehyde, 0.1% tannic acid in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). After fixation, samples were washed twice in 0.1M sucrose 0. 1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1h. Samples were washed once with 0.1M sucrose 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer and thrice in deionized water to eliminate excess of osmium. Sample dehydration started with 15min 30% ethanol bath and a second in 50% ethanol. At this step a first tissue contrast was realized in 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol at 4C on night. Sample dehydration continued with 40min successive baths of 70, 90, 95 and 100% ethanol and finished with a 100% acetone bath. Samples in solvent were progressively infiltrated with increasing concentration of Epon in an Epon/aceton mix. Once in 100% Epon, sample were disposed in Epon into flat embedding molds and put in oven at 60C for 48h for polymerization. Ultrathin sections of 80nm were cut with a diatom diamond knife on a LBK ultramicrotome Leica UCT and placed on coated square mesh copper grids. Sections were then counterstained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate and viewed with a FEI Tecnai G2 electron microscope. Digital images were acquired with a Veleta Camera (Olympus).StatisticsData were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism software.Publishers note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Anne-Laure Bailly and Florian Correard contributed equally.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Dr. Raphael Berges for technical help in animal experiments, the animal facility Centre dExploration Fonctionnelle Scientifique (CEFOS) agreement E 13-055-5, campus Timone Aix-Marseille University, the PICsL-FBI core electron microscopy facility (Acha Aouane, Fabrice Richard and Nicolas Brouilly, IBDM, AMU-Marseille UMR 7288), member of the national infrastructure France-BioImaging supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR-10-INBS-0004).

Engineering Intrinsically Zirconium89 Radiolabeled SelfDestructing Mesoporous Silica Nanostructures for In Vivo Biodistribution and Tumor Targeting Studies. Adv. Sci., 3: 1600122. doi: 10.1002/advs.201600122 1IntroductionInorganic nanomaterials have rapidly gained momentum in nanomedicine due to their unique physicochemical properties and partly due to their facile synthesis, biofunctionalization, and ease of loading a wide range of therapeutics.1 However, only a few have advanced beyond preclinical studies and even fewer have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical purposes.2, 3 An ideal theranostic nanoparticle is one which is safe and nonimmunogenic, can rapidly and specifically accumulate in the diseased tissue, map the biomedical/morphological status of the tissue, effectively deliver the therapy, and be degraded or cleared from the body in a reasonable time period.1 In this regard, biodegradable and renally clearable nanoparticles have emerged as frontrunners.4 While renal clearable nanomaterials (with a hydrodynamic diameter typically less than the glomerular threshold limit of 7 nm) alleviate the longterm toxicity concerns, great challenges still exist in engineering ultrasmall multifunctional nanoparticles with tunable blood circulation halflife, specific, enhanced, and persistent tumor accumulation, etc.4 Thus, a novel nanoplatform with suitable blood residence time and tumorspecific targeting ability in vivo, and that can selfdestruct into small fragments to facilitate clearance might hold greater promise for future clinical translation.Majority of previous reports on nanoparticle mediated drug delivery have been optimized only for smallmolecule drugs, thereby highlighting the urgent need for development of nanocarriers for potent biomacromolecular drugs, a rapidly developing area in cancer therapeutics.5, 6, 7, 8 Despite the therapeutic activity of a single biomacromolecular drug (e.g., small proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.) being equivalent to about 106108 of that a conventional small molecule anticancer agent (e.g., doxorubicin), issues like inefficient delivery to the target site and inability to cross the tumor cell membrane have severely limited their clinical applications.5 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), due to their large specific surface area, pore volume, and welldefined and easily tunable porous structure, have become one of the most intensively studied nanomaterials and have evolved spectacularly in the last two decades.9, 10 Silicon is a wellknown trace element in the human body and silica (i.e., SiO2) has been categorized as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA (ID Code: 14808607).11 Moreover, C dots are the only renal clearable inorganic nanoparticles that have gained Investigational New Drug (IND) approval by the FDA for firstinhuman clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov; ID: NCT01266096, NCT02106598).2, 12, 13 However, suboptimal in vivo pharmacokinetics of most reported MSNs, namely, inefficient tumor targeting and rapid sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system (RES, e.g., liver and spleen), as well as slow degradation and excretion have impeded their translational ability.14 To address these challenges, we propose an improved design for the silica nanoconjugates, wherein they can (1) entrap large molecular drugs, (2) selfdestruct over time, without the aid of any external agent or stimulus, (3) rapidly and specifically accumulate in tumor tissues in vivo, and (4) be tracked over a long period of time using intrinsically labeled zirconium89 (89Zr, t 1/2 = 78.4 h) and highly sensitive and quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.Dendritic, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) were synthesized, with a centrally radiating, twotiered porous network. The large pores (12 nm) served to load macromolecular cargo, as well as accelerate the degradation of the nanoparticles. The abundant deprotonated silanol (SiO) groups in bMSN were harnessed for chelatorfree labeling of oxophilic position emitting isotope (e.g., 89Zr) for tracing the in vivo biodistribution. The design of the nanoconjugates was further optimized for effective enhanced tumor vasculature targeting in 4T1 breast cancer murine models.2Results and Discussion2.1Synthesis and Characterization of bMSNsUniformly sized bMSNs with hierarchical dendritic networks were synthesized using a modified oilwater biphase stratification reaction system as reported in literature (see the Experimental Section for details).15 Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1 a) indicate monodispersed mesoporous nanopaticles, 162.9 6.4 nm in diameter bearing a spokelike radiating, rigid mesochanneled internal structure. The results were consistent with the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements which showed bMSNs with a slightly larger hydrodynamic diameter of 190.1 16.9 nm (Figure 1b). Furthermore, the concentration of bMSNs (number of nanoparticles mL1) was determined using the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) method on a NanoSight instrument (Video S1, Supporting Information). Results indicated a highly homogenous population with the estimated value of 8.97 1011 nanoparticles mL1 or 3.59 1014 g1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). These values also corroborated our theoretically calculated number of 9.68 1014 bMSNs g1 (detailed calculations shown in Section S.1, Supporting Information). Based on the Zhuravlev model,16 the concentration of silanol groups was estimated to be 1 107 per nanoparticle (Section S.2, Supporting Information).Figure 1Physicochemical characterization of bMSN. a) TEM image shows an average particle size 160 nm. (Scale bar: 200 nm) Outset schematic depicts the cross section of bMSN showing a twotiered porous structure. The inner pores measure 5.4 nm that continue into outer wider channels 12 nm in diameter.

As apparent from the nitrogen sorption isotherms (Figure 1d), assynthesized bMSNs demonstrate a broad pore size distribution, with the appearance of hysteresis and capillary condensation steps at relative pressures 0.2 P/P 0 0.8. The radial spokelike, twolevel pore structure appeared to possess a central core of densely packed channels (pore size: 5.4 nm) which continued into an outer connected ring of wider channels (pore size: 12.0 nm), seen clearly in Figure 1a. The bimodal pore size distribution was further confirmed by BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) analysis (Figure 1e). In addition, we also observed that using our simplified onepot synthetic protocol, the pore size could be easily tailored by simply altering the precursor (i.e., tetraethyl orthosilicate [TEOS]) to organic solvent (i.e., cyclohexane) ratio and reaction time; thus, bypassing the requirement of different organic solvents as reported previously.15 For example, by reducing the amount of TEOS precursor used (ratio: 1 v/v%) and extending the reaction time to 70 h, bMSNs with particle size of 285 nm and pore size of 17 nm were obtained (Figure S2, Supporting Information).2.2Degradation Study of Silica Nanoparticles (SNs)Rapid sequestration of nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic size larger than 10 nm by the macrophages, and subsequent nonspecific and prolonged residence of these phagocytosed nanoparticles in nontargeted organs (such as liver and spleen) has challenged the effectiveness of nanotheranostics.1 In this regard, selfdestructing silica nanoparticles which degrade into nontoxic and nonimmunogenic byproducts over time, can be a promising platform for nanoparticle based in vivo imaging and drug delivery. To test the degradability of bMSNs, assynthesized nanoparticles were incubated in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 C for a period of 21 d with constant stirring. It is well known that upon intracellular uptake, nanoparticles are routed to lysosome organelles, which are primary sites of intracellular sequestration and degradation of foreign particles and pathogens.17 Accordingly, the pH of the soaking solution was tuned to 45 to mimic the natural lysosomal environment. Aliquots were drawn at frequent intervals and centrifuged at high speed. The pellet was observed using TEM and the supernatant was analyzed with microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MPAES) to assess the Si concentration. Distinct changes in nanoparticle morphology could be observed within 1 d postincubation, when the outer edges began to erode into rougher surfaces (Figure 2 a, Day 1). The degradation accelerated thereafter and subsequent signs of obvious degradation could be seen at day 3 (Figure 2a, Day 3). 19.0 0.1% of the initial Si ion concentration was released into the SBF solution within 3 d of incubation. Erosion progressed inward from the outer edges, resulting in smaller and irregularly shaped nanoparticles and fragments (Figure 2a, Day 14). MPAES analysis corroborated these observations. With further degradation, the solution turned almost transparent from an initial milky white to completely transparent by day 21 (Figure S3c, Supporting Information). Only debris like silica fragments could be seen under the TEM (Figure 2a, Day 21) and almost complete breakdown resulted in 95.2 0.90% Si leaching into the solution, in the form of silicic acid (Figure 3 a).Figure 2In vitro selfdestruction of SNs. Serial TEM images of biodegradation behavior of a) bMSNs, b) MSNs, and c) dSNs, in a continuously stirred SBF environment at 37 C. All scale bars are 100 nm.Figure 3Systematic in vitro study. a) MPAES analysis of [Si] accumulated in SBF (at 37 C, pH 5). b) Cumulative release of SUN and BSA (in SBF at 37 C, pH 5). c) 89Zr labeling yields as a function of incubation time at 75 C, pH 78. d) Stability of 89Zr labeled SNs, in mouse serum at 37 C over 7 d (n = 3).To evaluate the influence of structure and pore size on degradability, two controls were used: solid or dense silica nanoparticles (dSNs; with no mesopores) and regular MSNs with a smaller pore size (23 nm). While bMSNs show a radially arranged porous network, dSNs have minimal porous structure and MSNs are composed of irregularly oriented mesochannels (Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information). As expected, both dSNs and MSNs showed much lower rates of degradation when compared to bMSNs. Even after 21 d of incubation in SBF, dSNs failed to show any appreciable change in morphology (Figure 2c, Day 21) or presence of Si ions in SBF (Figure 3a, orange line). MSNs displayed mild signs of degradation with somewhat distorted morphology and collapsed porous network after 21 d in SBF (Figure 2b, Day 21) and only 28% of the initial Si ion concentration was released at the end of the study period (Figure 3a, maroon line).The much more rapid degradation rate for bMSNs can be explained on the basis of their higher surface areas and lower degree of crosslinking of the silicate skeleton. The large pore size and hierarchically organized pores display a much larger surface area, as demonstrated earlier, which has been shown to enhance the degradation rate.18 In addition, Q 3/Q 4 ratio for dendritic bMSNs has been demonstrated to be 0.40.5,15 much smaller than that for MSNs19 and dSNs.20 The much lower degree of crosslinking between the silicate groups in bMSN may stem from the formation of dendritic porous channels resulting from the gentle condensation of silicates at the oilwater interface via the biphase stratification approach. In contrast rapid disorganized condensation of MSN porous network in the Stber process likely gives rise to a highly crosslinked silicate framework, which in turn may impede the degradation process. Further studies will be needed to study the degradation mechanism in detail. These results demonstrate that a hierarchical porous structure and larger pore diameter enhance the degradability of SNs by several folds, indicating the potential of bMSNs as a promising theranostic nanoplatform. Since, the physiological milieu is more complex, we believe that actual degradation of the nanoparticles should be more rapid in vivo, possibly aided by lysosomal enzymes. Ongoing studies aim to trace and improve upon the degradation process in vivo and decipher the exact mechanism. It is also worth mentioning that this time line of degradation of nanoparticles complements the purpose of drug delivery and imaging, where the nanocarrier is expected to degrade quickly enough to prevent any toxic reaction resulting from nonspecific accumulation, yet slow enough to prevent premature release of cargo during circulation. This is especially important for nanosystems with long blood circulation halflife. Hence, proper control over the degradation time and rate is essential for designing a clinically relevant nanovehicle. Extensive indepth studies are required in the future to carefully tailor the nanoparticle design and functionalization to develop an ideal, clinically translatable drug delivery vehicle.2.3Cargo Loading and ReleaseTumor cell heterogeneity and its implication for drug resistance have been the driving force for combination chemotherapy.21 MSNs with their high surface areatovolume ratios and easily tailorable chemistry provide an ideal platform to concurrently deliver multiple types of drugs to synergistically improve the efficacy of cancer therapeutics.10 Accordingly, to evaluate the effect of pore size and structure on cargo loading capacity, assynthesized SNs were suspended in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution of small molecule, hydrophobic antiangiogenesis drug (i.e., sunitinib malate [SUN]). Absence of a porous network resulted in minimal drug loading in dSNs, which showed only 8.4% loading efficiency. MSNs and bMSNs on the other hand, demonstrated high loading capacity, with up to 155.09 and 295.95 mg SUN loaded per g of nanoparticles, respectively (Table S2, Supporting Information). The large pore size of bMSNs provides an opportunity to load biomacromolecular therapeutics such as small proteins and even antibodies. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (molecular weight 66.5 kDa) was used as a model protein in this study to demonstrate the dual loading capacity of SNs. DLS measurements indicated the hydrodynamic size of BSA in PBS to be 8.63 nm; PDI 0.21. SUN loaded nanoparticles were suspended in a 2 mg mL1 PBS solution of BSA and gently mixed overnight. As expected, solid dSNs showed negligible encapsulation of the protein (1.5%). The effect of pore size on protein encapsulation was apparent. While small molecule drugs could be loaded at similar efficiency, distinct differences could be observed in protein loading capacities of the two types of porous nanostructures. 589.28 mg of BSA was encapsulated per g of bMSNs while only 250.0 mg could be loaded per g of MSN (Table S3, Supporting Information). Literature indicates that BSA assumes a prolate ellipsoidal structure hydrodynamically, with a longer and shorter axis.22 The lower but not zero loading of BSA into MSNs may result from wedging of the protein molecules into the smaller pore entrances through their shorter axes. The much larger hydrodynamic diameters compared to the small pore size (23 nm) of MSN rules out any real BSA loading inside the nanoparticles. SUN loading did not appreciably affect the loading of BSA, further attesting the efficacy of bMSNs to serve as nanocarriers for multiple cargo types and highlighting their potential for use in combination chemotherapy.The release of SUN and BSA from bMSNs and MSNs was then studied at 37 C in SBF (pH 5.0) to mimic the tumor microenvironment. Aliquots were drawn at regular time points and centrifuged to separate solid silica nanoparticles with entrapped SUN and BSA. The concentration of the released SUN and BSA was determined by measuring the UVvis absorption profiles of the supernatant at 460 and 280 nm, respectively. bMSNs and MSNs show distinctly different release profiles for both small molecule drug and larger protein (Figure 3b), which can be attributed to the differences in their mesostructures. MSNs with irregular mesoporous network of channels show an early burst release for both SUN and BSA within 10 h postincubation (42.74 2.98% and 59.22 5.54%, respectively). The quick release of SUN can be attributed to the diffusion of the drug loaded inside the MSN pores, climaxing at 56% cumulative release, upon reaching equilibrium. The rapid shedding of BSA was attributed to the dynamic nature of the in vitro experiment, since loosely wedged BSA molecules in the MSN pores could be easily freed in solution under shaking conditions. bMSNs, on the other hand, showed a multistage release for both SUN and BSA. Slow and steady release up to 24 h is followed by a sharp spike around day 3 (67.67 9.12% SUN and 83.31 6.89% BSA released) which coincides with accelerated fragmentation of bMSNs, indicating that degradability of bMSNs plays an important role in enhanced release of the loaded cargo. While traditional small pore MSNs rely only on equilibriumbased diffusion for release of the cargo, degradation of bMSNs provides greater opportunity for complete cargo release. Cumulative release of encapsulated drugs was found to be higher for bMSN (68.9 9.57% SUN and 93.13 7.67% BSA), when compared to MSN, further attesting the superiority of the degradable silica nanostructures. In addition to the enhanced release, the currently reported release profile is also better suited for longer circulating nanoparticles. A carefully tuned, slower release profile prevents premature shedding of cargo before the nanoconjugates have time to reach their target. Compared to the traditionally reported initialburstrelease behavior, a multistage release mechanism would potentially minimize offtarget toxicity. Moreover, the larger pores of bMSNs encapsulate larger amount of cargo and act as a protective support from the exogenous proteins and proteolytic attack in vivo, thereby enhancing the therapeutic index of the drugs multifold.2.4Intrinsic 89Zr Labeling of Silica NanoparticlesWe recently reported a novel application of mesoporous silica nanomaterials in intrinsic chelation of specific oxophilic radionuclides such as 89Zr.23 89Zr has an optimal halflife (t 1/2 = 78.4 h) and relatively low positron energy ( + avg = 395.5 keV), making it suitable for longterm in vivo tracking of nanoparticles, low uptake in the background tissue, and optimal dosimetry.24 For these reasons, 89Zr based radiopharmaceuticals are being actively translated to the clinic, with several clinical trials underway.25 The widely used protocol for 89Zr labeling involves a hexadentate chelator, desferrioxamine B (DFO). However, studies using DFO labeled tracers have still shown a significant bone uptake (after a week postinjection (p.i.)), indicative of the detached 89Zr, a wellknown osteophile.26, 27 Intrinsic labeling involving a carefully selected nanoplatform/radioisotope pair, can potentially overcome the problems associated with chelator instability and tedious chemistries for chelator functionalization.28 In the present study, silica nanoparticles were radiolabeled as described earlier.23 Briefly, SNs were incubated with 111 MBq of 89Zr (specific activity 20 GBq mol1) in 0.1 m HEPES (4(2hydroxyethyl)1piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer, pH 8 for 4 h at 75 C, with constant vigorous shaking. Rapid and highyield labeling was observed for all SNs. Comparable 89Zr labeling yields were observed for bMSNs (98.6%) and MSNs (95.8%) and slightly lower for dSNs (90.3%) (Figure 3c). However, serum stability tests are essential to assess the suitability of radiolabeled nanoparticles for in vivo applications. As evident from Figure 3d, majority of the 89Zr remained stably bound to bMSNs (95.60 0.01%) and MSNs (92.13 0.02%) up to 48 h postincubation in mouse serum. In comparison, 89Zr labeled dSNs showed much poorer stability, with only 52.84 0.03% 89Zr remaining stably chelated. High fidelity of the radiolabel to bMSNs can be attributed to the welldefined radial network of channels, which allows easy access to 89Zr ions into the interior recesses. Due to a large surface area, the core of the nanoparticle is expected to possess more neighboring deprotonated SiO groups which can stably chelate the oxophilic 89Zr, as compared to that on the surface. We believe that a much higher surface area of bMSN (741 m2 g1) stemming from hierarchically ordered large pore channels, compared to MSN (238 m2 g1),29 ensures the availability of greater number of deprotonated SiO groups available for more stable chelation of 89Zr. dSNs, on the other hand, possess little to no porous structure, keeping majority of the chelated 89Zr ions to the surface with fewer SiO groups. The coordination is expected to be weaker and hence 89Zr can easily dissociate from the parent dSNs over time. Encouraged by these results, 89 Zrlabeled bMSNs, were subsequently functionalized for in vivo studies.2.5Synthesis and Characterization of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105Prior to in vivo applications, assynthesized bMSNs were surface modified to impart optimal circulation time and tumor targeting capability, followed by systematic and thorough characterization. Scheme 1 depicts the major steps involved in the synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. bMSNs were first functionalized with amine groups (NH2) to aid in subsequent surface conjugations for in vivo studies. bMSNNH2 was then radiolabeled in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 8 for 2 h at 75 C. Presence of NH2 groups on bMSN did not appreciably affect the radiolabeling yield (94.7% within 2 h postincubation). The role of deprotonated silanol groups in 89Zr chelation was also confirmed by incubating bMSNNH2 in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, with the pH adjusted to 2. As expected, the radiolabeling yield was drastically reduced due to complete protonation of bMSNs under highly acidic conditions (Table S4, Supporting Information). Further, [89Zr]bMSNsNH2 was camouflaged with SCMPEG5kMal, in order to make them more bioactive and immune evasive for in vivo studies. Effective PEGylation is critical for longer circulation of nanoparticles and must be carefully tailored for each individual nanosystem. Succinimidyl carboxymethyl (SCM) is an NHS ester routinely used for PEGylation of primary amine bearing nanoparticles via amide linkage. However, it hydrolyzes rapidly in aqueous environments (0.75 min, pH 8). In the present study, twostep PEGylation was found to be more effective than a single step with same PEG amount and longer duration. The nanoconjugates demonstrated greater stability (at least two weeks in PBS) and longer circulation in vivo (data not shown).Scheme 1Schematic depiction of stepbystep synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. Uniform bMSNs (1) were modified with NH2 groups to form bMSNNH2 (2), followed by direct chelatorfree labeling with oxophilic 89Zr to form [89Zr]bMSNNH2 (3). Then (3) was PEGylated twice to yield [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kMal (4) which was subsequently conjugated with TRC105SH to obtain the final nanoconstructs, [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (5).Next, tumor targeting ability was conferred to the nanoconjugates by attachment of an antiCD105 antibody, i.e., TRC105, to the PEGylated samples. The antibody molecules were derivatized with thiol (SH) groups by reaction with Traut's reagent. About three thiol moieties per TRC105 were found to be optimal for nanoparticle conjugation. The conjugation of TRC105 to [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kMal was found to acutely depend on the reaction ratio, incubation time, and the number of reactive thiol groups on each antibody and had profound effect on in vivo biodistribution and targeting efficacy. Optimal results were obtained with the current protocol (details in the Experimental Section). Systematic calculations based on Bradford Assay, indicated that each bMSN has about 44 TRC105 molecules attached for an effective active targeting (Section S.3, Supporting Information). It is worth noting here that this number corroborates data from a previous report, where high (104 antibodies/nanoparticle) and low (15 antibodies/nanoparticle) ligand densities were shown to adversely affect the nanoparticlereceptor/antigen interactions due to crowding effects, and orientation and unfolding issues, respectively.30 Our ongoing studies aim to assess the effects of ligand density on in vivo nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting ability.Success of each step of the conjugation protocol was confirmed by the concurrently changing zeta potential values (Table S5, Supporting Information). Assynthesized bMSNs were negatively charged in PBS (48.37 0.31 mV) as expected due to deprotonated silanol groups at pH 2. [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 demonstrated a final zeta potential of 0.16 0.06 mV. This near neutral zeta potential of the nanoconjugates is advantageous since neutrally charged nanoparticles have been shown to circulate longer in the blood than their charged counterparts.31 2.6In Vivo Biodistribution and Tumor Vasculature Targeting with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105Angiogenesis plays a key role in tumor growth and metastasis and represents one of the most promising hallmarks for cancer diagnosis and treatment.32 CD105 or endoglin receptor, highly overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial cells and upregulated under hypoxic conditions, is a prime target for tumor imaging, prognosis, and antiangiogenic therapy in a variety of cancers including breast, colon, brain, and prostate.33 TRC105 (a human/murine chimeric IgG1) is a high avidity CD105targeted antibody, currently under multiple Phase II clinical trials.34 To assess the CD105 targeting of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, 2.8 1010 bMSN nanoconjugates were injected intravenously in 4T1 tumor bearing mice (14 mg kg1) and serial PET scans were performed 0.5, 6, 24, and 48 h p.i. Mice were randomized before injections and divided into three groups (n = 3 per group) designated as targeted, nontargeted, and blocking. Tumorbearing coronal slices are shown in Figure 4 . Regionofinterest (ROI) analysis was also performed and the timeactivity curves for the major sites of nanoparticle uptake can be seen in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).Figure 4In vivo tumor vasculature targeting. Representative tumorbearing coronal slices from serial PET scans. Targeted group: [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105; nontargeted group: [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k and blocking group: [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (with a preinjected blocking dose of TRC105). Yellow circles indicate the location of 4T1 breast tumor.Rapid and persistent uptake of nanoparticles was observed in the targeted group (4.5 0.6%ID g1) as soon as 0.5 h p.i., which increased to 11.4 2.1%ID g1, 6 h p.i., remaining constant thereafter up to 48 h p.i. (Figure 5 and Figure S5, Supporting Information). The control nontargeted and blocking groups injected with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (after a blocking dose 50 mg kg1 body weight; 6 h before injection), respectively, showed only minimal accumulation in the 4T1 tumors. Tumor uptake peaked at 3.6 0.3%ID g1 in the nontargeted group and 3.0 1.1%ID g1 in the blocking cohorts, indicating that CD105 targeting and not only enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, was responsible for the excellent and specific tumor uptake of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. Besides enhancement in absolute tumor uptake, [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 administration also resulted in greater tumor contrast and more rapid detection. Tumortomuscle (T/M) ratios, as high as 47.18 7.19 were obtained for the targeted group at 24 h p.i. (Figure 5 b and Table S6, Supporting Information). Not only T/M ratios, but also contrast index (CI) values were calculated to evaluate how well the tumor could be distinguished from normal tissues upon the introduction of targeted and nontargeted bMSNs (Figure 5c). Distinct enhancement in the CI values further demonstrated the advantage of CD105 targeting over passive targeting alone. Both [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k nanoconjugates demonstrated long circulation time with 1.2 0.3, 1.4 0.8, and 1.5 0.6%ID g1 remaining in the blood even after 24 h p.i. in the targeted, nontargeted, and blocking groups, respectively. Using a single bolus, twocompartment model, the elimination halflife (t 1/2) of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 was roughly evaluated to be 4.6 h (see Section S.4 and Figure S6, Supporting Information). Further studies are required for more accurate prediction of the distribution and elimination halflives of the intravenously injected nanoconjugates. The long residence time and enhanced tumor specific accumulation signify the promising potential of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 in cancer theranostics.Figure 5Quantitative regionofinterest (ROI) analysis and ex vivo biodistribution. Temporal variation of a) absolute tumor uptake, e) tumortomuscle ratio, and f) contrast index, for the targeted, nontargeted, and blocking groups. d) Ex vivo biodistribution data, 48 h p.i. (n = 3). The differences in tumor uptake between the targeted group and two control groups were statistically very significant (*P 0.05, **P 0.001, ***P 0.001).The uptake of the nanoconjugates in nontarget organs was confined to the RES organs, e.g., liver and spleen. Sequestration by the macrophages and phagocytes of the RES and eventual deposition in these organs is a common feature of intravenously injected nanoparticles, and was also observed in the present study. Importantly, the signal from the bone, indicative of detached 89Zr (89Zr is a wellknown osteophile35) remained low up to 48 h p.i. in all groups (1.3 0.6, 1.4 0.4, and 1.1 0.8%ID g1) and was much lower than that reported with DFO conjugated radiotracers.24 This finding further demonstrates the stability of intrinsic chelation of 89Zr by bMSNs. Interestingly, the signal from the joints increased at later time points (8%ID g1 in all groups) in accordance with the previous studies which show that 89Zr tends to preferentially accumulate in hypermineralized joints and epiphysis, likely due to chelation by hydroxylapatite, phosphates in the nonsoft ostium.35 At the terminal PET scans at 48 h p.i., mice from all three groups were euthanized and the harvested organs were analyzed by a welltype gammacounter detector. Ex vivo biodistribution data validated the PET ROI results and confirmed tumorspecific targeting with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (Figure 5d).In addition, biodistribution of the nanoparticles was studied up to day 7. A steep rise in the osteal accumulation of 89Zr can be clearly observed from the maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in Figure S7 (Supporting Information) at day 3, which increase persistently with time. This behavior can be attributed possibly to the degradation of the bMSN skeleton (also consistent with the in vitro studies) and to the transmetalation of 89Zr present on the bMSN exterior (more loosely coordinated than that inside) by the intrinsic chelators or plasma proteins. Interestingly, the increase in radioactivity in the joints was accompanied by a concomitant decline in the %ID g1 values in the liver after day 3, likely due to the excretion of bMSNs and their fragments. Ongoing studies aim to fully explore the in vivo degradation and excretory behavior of bMSNs in complex physiological environments.To confirm the CD105 specific uptake of the nanoconjugates, a separate cohort of 4T1 tumorbearing mice was used in histological analyses. Amine modified bMSNs were tagged with a fluorescent dye, fluoresceinNHS ester (E x/E m: 495/518 nm) followed by PEGylation and TRC105 conjugation as described before. The injected mice were euthanized 6 h p.i. and tumor and other major organs were harvested and stained for CD31 (an endothelial marker). Muscle tissue was examined as a normal control. Enhanced fluorescence signal (green) from the nanoparticles can be clearly discerned in the targeted tumor tissue (Figure S8, Supporting Information), which overlapped with the signal from CD31 (red), indicating that the distribution was largely on the vasculature with minor extravasation. The nontargeted tumor tissue, on the other hand, displays a weak signal from the nanoparticles. Consistent with our PET studies, liver and spleen tissues show high accumulation of the nanoparticles; however, the uptake is largely nonspecific with no overlap with the CD31 marker. The muscle tissue, as expected, does not emit any fluorescence signal (consistent with our PET results).3ConclusionIn summary, we report the first systematic in vivo study of intrinsically 89Zrlabeled bMSNs, targeted for CD105 marker specificity in murine metastatic breast cancer model. The hierarchical, dendritic silica nanoparticles display centrally radiating mesopore channels with a twotiered morphology. Large, bimodal pore size (5.4 and 12 nm) distribution and the unique highly organized nanostructure of bMSNs were harnessed in this study to create a selfdestructible dualdrug carrier. Both degradation and protein release studies demonstrated a gradual and easily tunable trend which is better suited for longer circulating nanoparticles and minimizes any premature release of the cargo. Chelatorfree 89Zr labeling demonstrated excellent yields and in vivo stability with marginal 89Zr detachment and bone uptake. Careful tailoring of the synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 resulted in excellent CD105 specificity, which was confirmed by extensive in vivo and ex vivo testing. Vascular targeting exhibited greater than threefold enhancement in absolute tumor uptake and normal tissue contrast, when compared with EPR dependent uptake of the nanoconjugates.Considering the safety and easy tunability of silica nanoparticles, our simple and versatile approach to create selfdestructing angiogenesis targeted nanoplatforms can potentially pave the way for future personalized nanotheranostics. Through simple surface modifications, the nanoparticles can be tailored to (i) label a wide plethora of clinically relevant diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes (such as 45Ti (t 1/2 = 3.1 h), 177Lu (t 1/2 = 6.7 d), etc.) without the need for tiresome specific chelator chemistries, (ii) carry smallmolecule and large biomolecular drugs concurrently for combination therapy, (iii) specifically target multiple tumor types by modifying the targeting ligand, and (iv) selfdestruct to allow excretion from the body within a reasonable time period.4Experimental Section Materials: TRC105 was provided by TRACON Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA). NHS fluorescein, Chelex 100 resin (50100 mesh), TEOS, triethanolamine (TEA), (3aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APS), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride solution (CTAC, 25 wt%), cyclohexane, and BSA were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). AlexaFluor488 and Cy3labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, CA). PD10 columns were procured from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Absolute ethanol, sodium chloride (NaCl), and SUN were purchased from Fisher Scientific. SCMPEG5kMal was obtained from Creative PEGworks. Water and all buffers were of Millipore grade and pretreated with Chelex 100 resin to ensure that the aqueous solution was free of heavy metals. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Synthesis of Biodegradable Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: bMSNs with radially arranged mesochannels were synthesized using a biphase stratification method, reported previously, with slight modifications.15 For the synthesis of 160 nm sized bMSN with pore sizes of 5 and 12 nm, 24 mL CTAC, 180 mg TEA, and 36 mL water were stirred continuously at 60 C for 1 h. 1 mL TEOS in 19 mL cyclohexane solution (5 v/v%) was then added gently to the mixture and stirred (125 rpm) for 60 h. Asformed bMSNs in the aqueous layer were collected thereafter, by high speed centrifugation, followed by washing and removal of the CTAC template by immersion in 1 wt% NaClmethanol solution. The samples were washed repeatedly till all CTAC was removed. Synthesis of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: MSNs with a hydrodynamic size of 115 nm and pore size of 23 nm were synthesized as described previously.36 Briefly, 2 g CTAC and 20 mg TEA were stirred in 20 mL water for 1 h at room temperature. 1 mL TEOS was then added to the mixture and stirred in a water bath at 95 C for another 1 h. Assynthesized MSNs were collected by high speed centrifugation and subjected to NaClmethanol (1 wt%) treatment to remove the CTAC template. Synthesis of Dense Silica Nanoparticles: dSNs with a hydrodynamic diameter of 100 nm were synthesized using a modified Stber method.23 35.7 mL of absolute ethanol was mixed with 5 mL of water and 0.8 mL of ammonia and stirred for 10 min at room temperature. 1 mL TEOS was then added and the mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 1 h. dSNs were collected by centrifugation and washed with water/ethanol to remove the residual components. Characterization: TEM images were obtained on an FEI T12 microscope, operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. TEM samples were prepared on carbon coated copper grids following standard protocols. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Quantachrome Nova 4000e system. The samples were first calcined at 650 C for 12 h to ensure the removal of organic template. Surface area was determined using the BET method. Pore size distribution data were collected by the BJH method of the desorption branch of the isotherm. DLS and zeta potential analysis were performed on NanoZetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd.). Nanoparticle number was determined using NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Instruments Ltd.). Amine Modification of SNs: Amine groups were introduced onto silica nanoparticles to facilitate further surface conjugations. Assynthesized SNs were suspended in 20 mL absolute ethanol and reacted with APS (1 mL) at room temperature for 48 h. Thereafter, the sample was washed multiple times with ethanol to get rid of residual APS. Ninhydrin test was used to determine NH2 group concentration per mL of SNs. In Vitro Degradation in Simulated Body Fluid: SBF with ion concentration approximately equal to those of human blood plasma was prepared per the well documented recipe (Table S7, Supporting Information).37 pH was adjusted to 5.5 using HCl (1 m). In vitro degradation behaviors were studied by incubating equal amounts (3.5 mg) of all three types of SNs in 10 mL SBF solution (pH 5.5) with gentle stirring (350 rpm) at 37 C. Aliquots were drawn at regular intervals, replaced by equal amount of fresh SBF solution. The extracted solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm. The pellet containing intact and fragmented nanoparticles was observed under the TEM. The supernatant was subjected to MPAES analysis (Agilent 4200 MPAES, CA) to determine the concentration of the released Si ions ([Si]tSupernatant).In addition, initial concentration of Si ions in the three SN samples ([Si]0SN) as well as basal Si concentration in the SBF solution ([Si]0SBF) were separately determined. Percentage Si accumulated in the SBF at each timepoint was determined as follows(1)[Si]tSBF=[Si]tSupernatant[Si]0SBF[Si]nSN100 Cargo Loading and Release Studies: Small molecule anticancer drug SUN and macromolecular protein BSA (66.5 kDa) were used as model therapeutic agents to demonstrate dual cargo encapsulation efficacy of SNs. SUN loading was carried out by dispersing equal amounts of SNs in a 2 mg mL1 solution of SUN in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 24 h with constant shaking, followed by centrifugation to remove any unencapsulated SUN. SUN concentration in the supernatant was determined based on the standard curve in DMSO at 460 nm. As prepared SN(SUN) samples were subsequently added to BSA solution (2 mg mL1 in PBS) and mixed gently for 24 h. Excess unloaded BSA was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was quantified at 280 nm using Nanodrop fluorospectrometer.Loading efficacy was defined as the ratio of guest molecule loaded in the nanoparticles to the total amount added (2)Loadingefficiency(%)=AmountofdrugloadedinSNsTotalamountofdrugadded100 Loading capacity defined as amount of drugs loaded per g of nanocarrier, was calculated using the following equation(3)Loadingcapacity(%)=AmountofdrugloadedinSNsAmountofSNs100 To carry out the release study, bMSN(SUNBSA) and MSN(SUNBSA) were suspended in SBF solution (pH 5.5) accompanied with gentle shaking. Aliquots were drawn periodically, centrifuged at high speed, and tested for released SUN and BSA using UVvis absorption at 460 and 280 nm, respectively. 89Zr Production: 89Zroxalate was produced according to previously reported procedures by the University of WisconsinMadison cyclotron group.38 Briefly, natural yttrium89 (89Y) foil (250 m, 99.9%) was irradiated with a proton beam to produce 89Zr via the 89Y(p,n)89Zr reaction by using a 16 MeV GE PETtrace cyclotron. After isotope separation and purification, 89Zroxalate was obtained, with a specific activity of 20 GBq mol1 of 89Zr. ChelatorFree 89Zr Labeling: 1 mL of asprepared aminated SNs in HEPES buffer (pH 7.5; 0.1 m) were mixed with 111 MBq 89Zr oxalate and the pH was adjusted to 89 using Na2CO3 solution (2 m). The mixture was incubated at 75 C for 4 h. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to quantify 89Zr labeling yields at different time points, using 0.05 m EDTA as the mobile phase. Final labeled products were collected by centrifugation. In Vitro Serum Stability: In vitro stability of the isotope was evaluated in serum by incubating 300 L of [89Zr]SN with 300 L of 2 whole mouse serum with constant shaking at 37 C for 7 d. At each timepoint, 100 L of the sample was withdrawn and purified by a 100 kDa centrifugal filter. Radioactivity in the filtrate and retentate were measured using a gamma counter and decayed back to day 0 for further calculations. Thiolation of TRC105: TRC105 antibody was thiolated to facilitate conjugation to bMSNs. 100 L of TRC105 (7 mg mL1) was mixed with Traut's reagent (2 mg mL1) in 1:30 molar ratio and reacted at room temperature for 1 h. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8, using 0.1 m Na2CO3. At the end of the incubation period, the mixture was purified on PD10 columns to get rid of residual Traut's reagent. The final concentration of TRC105SH was quantified using Nanodrop instrument. Ellman's reagent was used to quantify the number of SH moieties per antibody. Synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105: [89Zr]bMSNNH2 was further surface modified to make them suitable for in vivo targeted imaging. [89Zr]bMSNNH2 water solution (pH 67) was added to 2.5 mg (500 nmol) SCMPEG5kMal and reacted for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the excess PEG was removed by centrifugation. The PEGylation step was repeated under similar conditions. [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k was obtained after washing atleast twice with PBS and divided into two parts. Finally, 2.5 nmol of TRC105SH was added to onehalf of the above solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 was obtained as the final product and used for the targeted and blocking groups. The other half ([89Zr]bMSNPEG5k) was used as the nontargeted group. 4T1 Tumor Models: 4T1 breast cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with FBS and antibiotics). 2 106 cells, suspended in PBS were injected subcutaneously into the front flank of 45 weeks old Balb/c mice (Envigo, IN, USA) to establish the tumors. The animals were used for in vivo experiments once the tumor diameters reached 58 mm. In Vivo Vasculature Targeted PET Imaging: All animal studies were conducted per the protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 4T1 tumorbearing mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 3). 150 L (7.4 MBq) of either [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 or [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k was injected intravenously and serial PET scans were performed at various timepoints. The mice in the blocking group were each injected with unlabeled TRC105 antibody (dose: 5 mg kg1), 6 h before [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 administration.Serial PET scans (at 0.5, 6, 24, and 48 h p.i.) were performed using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.). Image acquisition, reconstruction, and ROI analysis were performed as described previously.38 All PET data were decay corrected to the initial timepoint and is presented as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID g1). Contrast enhancement was calculated in terms of two parameters: Tumortomuscle ratio (4)(T/M)=BqmL1intumorBqmL1inmuscle (5)Contrastindex(CI)=BqmL1(tumor)BqmL1(muscle)BqmL1(contralateralregion)BqmL1(muscle) (Same volume ROIs were drawn on tumor and contralateral regions on the same plane/frame in the tomographic dataset.) Ex Vivo Biodistribution: Ex vivo biodistribution studies were carried out after the final PET scans at 48 h p.i. to ensure that the quantitative uptake from the PET ROI values truly represented the radioactivity distribution in 4T1 tumorbearing mice. The mice were euthanized and all the major tissues were harvested and wet weighted. The radioactivity measurements for each tissue were carried out using a gamma counter (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA) and presented as %ID g1. Histology: To carry out histological analysis of the major tissues, fluoresceinNHS dye conjugated bMSNs (FITCbMSNPEG5kTRC105 and FITCbMSNPEG5k) were injected intravenously in 4T1 tumorbearing mice. The tissues were harvested at 6 h p.i. and fixed in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) formulation prior to sectioning. Frozen tissue slices of 6 m were fixed with cold acetone and stained for endothelial marker CD31, as described previously through the use of a rat antimouse CD31 antibody and a Cy3labeled donkey antirat IgG.39 All images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope.Supporting informationAs a service to our authors and readers, this journal provides supporting information supplied by the authors.

However, their long-term in vivo integrity and potential mismatch of the biodistribution patterns between nanoparticles and radio-isotopes are two major concerns for this approach. Here, we present a chelator-free zirconium-89 (89Zr, t1/2 = 78.4 h) labeling of mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) with significantly enhanced in vivo long-term (20 days) stability. Successful radio-labeling and in vivo stability are demonstrated to be highly dependent on both the concentration and location of deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) from two types of silica nanoparticles investigated. This work reports 89Zr-labeled MSN with a detailed labeling mechanism investigation and long-term stability study. With its attractive radio-stability and the simplicity of chelator-free radio-labeling, 89Zr-MSN offers a novel, simple, and accurate way for studying the in vivo long-term fate and PET image-guided drug delivery of MSN in the near future.zirconium-89mesoporous silica nanoparticlechelator-free radio-labelingpositron emission tomographydocument-id-old-9nn5b00526document-id-new-14nn-2015-005266ccc-pricePositron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive and noninvasive imaging modality, which is playing a vital role in nano-oncology for assessing the quantitative tumor uptake and studying the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of radio-labeled nanoparticles in live animals.1,2 To date, chelator-based radio-labeling is still the most widely used technique for the synthesis of various kinds of radio-labeled nanoparticles. For example, copper-free click chemistry has been developed to attach fluorine-18 (18F, t1/2 = 109 min) to porous silica nanoparticles.3,4 By using either NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraaceticacid) as the chelator, copper-64 (64Cu, t1/2 = 12.7 h)-labeled carbon nanotubes,5 quantum dots,6 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs),7 porous silica nanoparticles,8,9 to name a few, have also been reported and used for tumor-targeted cancer imaging and biodistribution studies.Despite the high sensitivity and no limitation in tissue penetration of signal, radio-labeled nanoparticles still provoke concerns of their in vivo (long-term) integrity (or stability).10 For example, dissociation of free 64Cu (or 64Cu-DOTA) and significant bladder uptake have been reported during the in vivo PET imaging of 64Cu-DOTA-PEG-Au.11 It is worthy to mention that the nanoparticle itself is not a positron emitter, and PET imaging only detects signals from the radio-isotopes (which usually are linked to the nanoparticle with a selected chelator as the bridge). Most free radio-isotopes (or isotopes stabilized by chelators) do not share the same PK profile with the nanoparticle of interest. Potential detachment of these radio-isotopes from nanoparticles in vivo could easily lead to erroneous interpretation of PET imaging results.To address these concerns, there is an emerging concept of synthesizing intrinsically radio-labeled nanoparticles for more accurate investigation of the nanoparticles PK profile in vivo.12 Successful synthesis of intrinsically radio-labeled nanoparticle lies in the strong interaction between rationally selected nanoparticles and radio-isotopes.12 Interesting combinations, such as 64Cu-labeled porphysome,13 arsenic-72 (72As, t1/2 = 26 h), and germanium-69 (69Ge, t1/2 = 39.1 h)-labeled SPION,14,15 [64Cu]CuS nanoparticles,1618F-labeled upconversion nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite,17,18etc., have been reported over the last several years. Although still in the early stages, design and synthesis of intrinsically radio-labeled nanoparticles have shown an attractive potential in offering an easier, faster, more stable, and more specific radio-labeling technique for the next generation of nano-oncology.Zirconium-89 (89Zr, t1/2 = 78.4 h) is a radio-isotope with a relatively low positron energy (+avg = 395.5 keV), which is highly suitable for long blood circulating monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based PET imaging.19 Importantly, translational research of 89Zr-based agents is now under active development with at least five clinical trials ongoing in the USA alone (many more in Europe).20 Desferrioxamine B (DFO), a hexadentate ligand with three hydroxamate groups that provide six oxygen donors for metal binding, is currently the preferred chelator for labeling of 89Zr4+.2125 However, significant bone uptake of 89Zr (315 %ID/g) was still observed for various 89Zr-DFO-mAb studies within 7 days postinjection (p.i.),2225 indicating the release of free 89Zr and limited stability of DFO-based 89Zr labeling.Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with controllable mesoporous structure, high specific surface area, and large pore volume have attracted increasing interest as drug delivery nanosystems.26 The presence of abundant silanol groups (SiOH) on the silica surface has been well-known for many decades.27 However, this has not been considered for potential radio-labeling until now.In this work, we hypothesize that numerous deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) inside the meso-channels or on the surface of MSN could function as inherent hard oxygen donors for stable radio-labeling of 89Zr. By using an amorphous dense silica nanoparticle as a control, our systematic research demonstrated a significantly enhanced stability of 89Zr-MSN in mice over 3 weeks (7 t1/2 of 89Zr). This study provides a chelator-free labeling mechanism for mesoporous silica nanoparticles to study their long-term in vivo stability and fate.Results and DiscussionMSN Synthesis and CharacterizationZr4+ is a hard Lewis acid and thus prefers hard Lewis bases as donor groups. It has been known for many decades that, during the hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), abundant silanol groups (SiOH) form on the surface of amorphous silica particles.27 Here, we demonstrate that it is the deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) that function as the hard Lewis bases for the successful chelator-free 89Zr labeling of amorphous silica nanoparticles.As seen in Figure 1a, a uniform MSN with an average particle size of 150 nm in diameter was synthesized using literature procedures.28 The presence of radial meso-channels throughout each MSN could be easily seen from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms further confirmed an obvious capillary condensation step at P/P0 around 0.4 (Figure 1b), which is clear evidence for the presence of mesopores in MSN. The second adsorption of the isotherms at high relative pressure (P/P0 0.8) represents the formation of interstitial pores among the dried MSN agglomerates (also known as textural porosity). The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area was measured to be 581.5 m2/g, with a high pore volume of 1.3 cm3/g. Pore size distribution showed an average pore size of 45 nm (Figure 1b, inset), consistent with the previously reported values.28Figure 1Chelator-free 89Zr labeling of MSN. (a) TEM image of MSN with an average particle size of 150 nm. (b) Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of MSN. (c) Schematic illustration showing the labeling of 89Zr4+ to the deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) from the outer surface and inner meso-channels of MSN. (d) Time-dependent 89Zr labeling yield in HEPES buffer solution (pH 78) with varied MSN concentrations (from 2 mg/mL to 2 104 mg/mL).According to the Zhuravlev model, for both porous and nonporous silica particles, the concentrations of silanol groups are directly proportional to the specific surface area, with the density (SiOH/nm2) found to be in the range of 45 (also known as the KiselevZhuravlev constant).27 About 23 million SiOH groups in each MSN particle were estimated based on our calculation (detailed in Supporting Information, Table S1). Considering that over 95% of the surface in MSN is internal mesopore surface based on a recent hemolysis study of MSN,29 nearly all of the SiOH groups are expected to be inside the meso-channels but not on MSNs outer surface, as schematically shown in Figure 1c.These silanol groups (SiOH) can be fully deprotonated to become SiO when the pH value of aqueous solution is higher than the isoelectric point of silica, which has been known to be in the range of pH 23. Our -potential analysis confirmed the negatively charged surface of as-synthesized MSN (48.4 0.3 mV) in water (pH 78), suggesting the presence of SiO groups on MSN surface.Chelator-Free 89Zr LabelingOur results showed that about 70% 89Zr labeling yield was achieved for MSN within the first 15 min of incubation (Table S2). The yield continued to increase over time and reached 82.5% at 2 h post-incubation (Figure 1d and Table S2). As expected, 89Zr-labeling was MSN concentration and temperature dependent, where higher concentration and high incubation temperature gave higher labeling yield (Figure 1d, Figure S1, Table S3). We further demonstrated that there was no significant reduction (less than 5%) of drug loading capacity after labeling MSN with 89Zr (Table S4).To further demonstrate the role of deprotonated silanol groups in 89Zr-labeling, the pH value of MSN in HEPES (0.1 M) was adjusted to 23 to ensure protonation of silanol groups (as SiOH). Such protonation was confirmed by a positively charged surface (3.6 0.3 mV) of MSN at pH 23. As expected, 89Zr labeling yield was significantly reduced even at a MSN concentration of 2 mg/mL (Figure S1 and Table S3). With these findings, we demonstrated that deprotonated silanol groups play a vital role in chelator-free labeling of 89Zr to MSN.In Vitro Stability Study of 89Zr-MSNTo further investigate how the location and concentration of deprotonated silanol groups could affect the 89Zr labeling yield and stability, dSiO2 was used as a control. Amorphous dSiO2 synthesized by a classic Stber method is known to have no mesopores inside and a significantly lower surface area (40 m2/g for dSiO2 with a size of 90 nm in diameter, Figure S2) when compared with that of MSN (600 m2/g in this work).30 In stark contrast to MSN, very little mesopore surface but a dominant external surface is expected in these dSiO2 nanoparticles, as schematically shown in Figure 2a.Figure 2Chelator-free 89Zr labeling of dSiO2. (a) Schematic illustration showing the labeling of 89Zr4+ to the deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) from the outer surface of dSiO2. (b) TEM image of dSiO2 with an average particle size of 90 nm. (c) Time-dependent 89Zr labeling yield in HEPES buffer solution (pH 78) with varied dSiO2 concentrations (from 2 mg/mL to 2 104 mg/mL).The TEM image in Figure 2b shows successful synthesis of spherically shaped dSiO2 with an average size of 90 nm in diameter. The surface charge of dSiO2 in pH 78 water was also found to be highly negative (38.9 0.3 mV), confirming the presence of abundant deprotonated silanol groups on the outer surface of dSiO2. In comparison with MSN, about 17-fold less SiO groups in each dSiO2 was estimated based on their marked difference in specific surface area (Table S1). By using the same labeling protocol, a similar concentration-dependent 89Zr labeling yield was observed (Figure 2c). As expected, we found significantly lower labeling yield at each time point examined when compared with MSN with the same particle concentration (Tables S2 and S5), again demonstrating the vital role of SiO group concentration during 89Zr labeling.A DFO challenge study has been reported to demonstrate the stability of 89Zr-labeled nanoparticles.31 As-synthesized 89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2 (suspended in HEPES, 0.1 M, pH 78) were mixed with increasing concentrations of DFO, ranging from 0.05 to 5 mM, and incubated at 37 C under constant shaking. At each time point, a 100k filter was used to separate the formation of possible 89Zr-DFO. As shown in Figure 3a,b, nearly negligible 89Zr detachment was detected for both 89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2 within 48 h, demonstrating a strong binding affinity of 89Zr to both silica nanoparticles. The stability of 89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2 in complete mouse serum was further tested. 89Zr-labeled nanoparticles were mixed with mouse serum and shaken at 37 C. Again, no obvious detachment of free 89Zr was observed, with 89Zr-MSN showing slightly better serum stability (Figure 3c). Similar high radio-stability (with over 96% 89Zr retained in MSN) has been observed after challenging with EDTA (1 mM) at 37 C for 7 days (Figure 3d). Taken together, we concluded that both 89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2 showed high stability in vitro, which encouraged us to test their long-term stabilities in vivo.Figure 3In vitro stability of 89Zr-labeled silica nanoparticles. Stability of (a) 89Zr-MSN and (b) 89Zr-dSiO2 when challenged with DFO of varied concentrations from 0.05 to 5 mM at 37 C for 48 h. (c) Stability of 89Zr-MSN (red line) and 89Zr-dSiO2 (blue line) in whole mouse serum at 37 C for 48 h. (d) Stability study of 89Zr-MSN when challenged with EDTA (1 mM) at 37 C for 1 week.In Vivo Long-Term Stability and Biodistribution StudiesWith a 3 day half-life, 89Zr-based PET imaging holds great potential as a useful tool for long-term monitoring of the dynamic biodistribution, biodegradation, clearance pathway, and rate of nanoparticles (or mAbs) in vivo. However, a major challenge still exists in developing an optimal chelator for 89Zr labeling. Although our in vitro DFO challenge and serum stability studies suggested high stability of 89Zr in both MSN and dSiO2, their ultimate stability needs to be tested in vivo for a long period of time.To do that, healthy BALB/c mice (n = 3) were intravenously (i.v.) injected with 89Zr-MSN or 89Zr-dSiO2 and monitored for 3 weeks (7 t1/2 of 89Zr). Since detached free 89Zr is a well-known osteophilic cation,32 with a fast and retained uptake in bones,33 monitoring the change of bone uptake could be one of the best ways to study the in vivo stability of 89Zr-labeled nanoparticles. Our in vivo PET and maximum intensity projection images of mice injected with free 89Zr-oxalate (in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) also confirmed high uptake of 89Zr in the bones and joints, as shown in Figure S3.Considering that MSN with a larger (e.g., 5 nm) pore size has a faster biodegradation rate in simulated body fluid,28 in order to potentially visualize the degradation process of 89Zr-MSN using PET imaging, we used 90 nm sized MSN with a high surface area (710.7 m2/g) and 910 nm pore size (Figure 4) in the in vivo stability study (Figure 5). Normal dSiO2 with a similar particle size served as the control group.Figure 4(a) TEM image of MSN with an average particle size of 90 nm. (b) Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of MSN. BET surface area was estimated to be 710.7 m2/g, and the average pore size was about 910 nm.Figure 5In vivo radiostability and ex vivo biodistribution studies.

(f) In vivo serial coronal maximum intensity projection PET images of mice at different time points after i.v. injection of 89Zr-MSN. (g) Schematic illustration of 89Zr-MSN. (h) Biodistribution study of 89Zr-MSN on day 21 p.i.TEM images of 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSN (after decay of radio-activity) showed no obvious morphology change after 89Zr labeling (Figure 5c,e). The maximum intensity projection images showed dominant liver and spleen uptake with no obvious bone uptake within 3 h p.i. in both cases (Figure 5d,f). However, mice injected with 89Zr-dSiO2 started to show significant bone uptake (6.5 5.9 %ID/g; n = 3) from day 1 p.i., which increased to 11.1 7.5 %ID/g on day 3 p.i. (video S1), indicating that the exposed 89Zr from the dSiO2 surface can be vulnerable to attack by the endogenous (protein) ligands. Burst detachment (denoted as stage 1) of free 89Zr from dSiO2 can also be seen in Figure 6a. No further increase in bone uptake and a slow clearance of 89Zr from bone were observed over the next 18 days (denoted as stage 2, Figure 5d, Figure 6a, and Table S6), suggesting a strong binding of the remaining 89Zr on the surface of dSiO2.Figure 6Quantitative region of interest analysis of the dynamic uptake change of 89Zr in bone and liver. Timeactivity curves of bone (a) and liver (c) upon i.v. injection of 89Zr-dSiO2 or 89Zr-MSN into BALB/c mice over 21 days. Linear fitting of 89Zr in (b) bone during stage 1 and (d) liver during stage 2.Surprisingly, mice injected with 89Zr-MSN showed an extremely high in vivo stability throughout 3 weeks, with less than 1 %ID/g uptake in bone on day 7 p.i. (video S2), which remains very low at 1.5 0.2 %ID/g at 2 more weeks later (Figure 5h, Figure 6a, and Table S6). The much smaller (but not zero) uptake in bones for 89Zr-MSN may be attributed to the detachment of 89Zr4+ ions, which are on the outer surface and not necessarily inside the pores of the MSNs. Such ions form a small fraction of the total labeled activity (due to much higher internal surface area in each MSN29). Since the coordination between silanol groups and 89Zr4+ ions is expected to be weaker on the outer surface (due to fewer surrounding silanol groups) than inside the meso-channels, the surface-bound 89Zr4+ ions may be rendered more vulnerable to endogenous chelators. Remarkably, the detachment rate of 89Zr from MSN was found to be 20-fold slower than that of 89Zr from dSiO2 (Figure 6b), clearly indicating the vital role of meso-channels in protecting 89Zr from attack by the endogenous chelators. Although 89Zr-labeled MSN using DFO as the chelator has been reported,21 this is the longest in vivo stability study of 89Zr-labeled MSN with such high stability, which could open up a new possibility for studying the long-term fate of MSN-based nanoparticles in live animals.In addition to the dynamic change of 89Zr uptake in bone, our region of interest (ROI) quantification also provided highly accurate information regarding the accumulation and clearance rate of 89Zr-MSN in mouse liver. Figure 6c shows an increased liver uptake of 89Zr-MSN from 29.7 4.8 %ID/g (n = 3) at 0.5 h p.i. to 39.5 4.5 %ID/g on day 7 p.i. For 89Zr-dSiO2, a significant reduction of 89Zr in liver, from 38.1 14.5 to 27.0 0.3 %ID/g due to the lower stability of 89Zr on the surface of dSiO2, was observed over the first 7 days (Table S7). Of note, such dramatic 89Zr uptake change did not correctly reflect the real distribution change of dSiO2 in the liver (i.e., dSiO2 was not cleared from the mouse liver over this time period, but the radio-isotope 89Zr was) and was the main reason for increased 89Zr bone uptake in mice injected with 89Zr-dSiO2, as shown in Figure 5d and 6a (stage 1).The hepatic clearance of 89Zr-MSN was also observed with a gradual decrease in liver uptake to 34.2 3.3 %ID/g on day 21 p.i. (Figure 6c and Table S7). Interestingly, we found the same hepatic clearance rate for both 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSN from day 3 to day 21, with their linear fitting slopes both estimated to be 0.01 (Figure 6d). Dominant liver/spleen uptake of 89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2 (as expected for i.v. injected nanoparticles) and significantly higher bone uptake of free 89Zr detached from the dSiO2 surface (but not from MSN) were further confirmed in the ex vivo biodistribution studies on day 21 p.i. (Figure 5b,h and Table S8).Renal clearance of porous silicon (130180 nm in diameter) after degradation in vivo has been previously reported.34 MSN with an average pore size larger than 5 nm has been reported to have a decent (within 3 days) degradation rate in vitro.28 Neither bladder nor kidney uptake of 89Zr-MSN (average pore size: 910 nm, Figure 4 and Figure 5f) fragments was observed in this study. Without PEGylation, 89Zr-MSN with a highly negatively charged surface was expected to be accumulated in liver and spleen shortly.Although bare (unmodified/non-PEGylated) silica nanoparticles were used here in order to better study the chelator-free radio-labeling mechanism and in vivo long-term stability, suitable surface functionalization is needed before they can be considered as drug delivery systems. Our pilot studies have successfully demonstrated the in vivo tumor active targeting of porous-silica-based nanoparticles (e.g., hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle or yolk/shell structured nanoparticle), by modifying nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (molecular weight: 5 kDa) and targeting ligands (e.g., TRC105, an anti-CD105 antibody; or YY146, an anti-CD146 antibody) (unpublished data).We also believe the use of intrinsic deprotonated silanol groups from MSN (or other mesoporous silica-coated nanoparticles) for chelator-free radio-labeling may be applicable to other oxophilic radio-metals, such as titanium-45 (45Ti, t1/2 = 184.8 m), scandium-44 (44Sc, t1/2 = 3.97 h), indium-111 (111In, t1/2 = 2.8 d), yttrium-90 (90Y, t1/2 = 64.0 h), to name a few. Considering that PEGylated MSN can only circulate in the blood for a couple of hours (depending on the particle size, surface charge, and PEG density, etc.), 89Zr with a half-life greater than 3 days might not be the best isotope for short-term PET imaging studies. However, thanks to the general applicability of the as-proposed labeling mechanism, other short-lived oxophilic radio-metals (such as 45Ti and 44Sc) could be used for better matching the biological half-life of PEGylated MSN. Silica-based chelator-free 89Zr labeling can also benefit other applications, such as systematic and long-term in vivo biodegradation and biodistribution tracking of MSN (with varied particle and pore sizes), which could provide highly valuable information regarding the in vivo fate, potential toxicity, drug delivery, and chemotherapeutic efficacy of MSN in the near future.ConclusionsIn conclusion, herein we report a chelator-free technique to stably label 89Zr to MSN. Systematic studies demonstrated the vital role of deprotonated silanol groups during the labeling of 89Zr to amorphous porous and nonporous silica nanoparticles. 89Zr labeling yield was concentration- and temperature-dependent, where higher silica concentration and higher incubation temperature gave higher 89Zr labeling yield. In vitro DFO challenge and serum stability studies demonstrated the strong binding affinity of 89Zr to both MSN and dSiO2 with nearly negligible 89Zr detachment within 48 h. Remarkably, 89Zr-MSN exhibited high in vivo stability with very little bone uptake over 3 weeks. The detachment rate of 89Zr from MSNs meso-channels was further found to be 20-fold slower than that of 89Zr from the dSiO2 surface in vivo, highlighting the vital role of meso-channels in stabilizing 89Zr inside MSN.Considering that silica (or silicon dioxide) is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration (ID Code: 14808-60-7),35 which is highly desirable for future clinical translation, and silica coating has been widely used in biomedical applications,36,37 the as-developed labeling technique might provide a simpler yet more reliable method for theranostic application of future silica-based radio-labeled nanoparticles.Materials and Methods89Zr Production89Zr-oxalate was produced according to our previous procedures by the University of WisconsinMadison cyclotron group.38 Briefly, natural yttrium-89 (89Y) foil (250 m, 99.9%) was irradiated with a proton beam to create 89Zr via the 89Y(p,n)89Zr reaction by using a 16 MeV GE PETtrace cyclotron. After isotope separation and purification, 89Zr-oxalate was obtained, which has a specific activity of 20 GBq/mol of Zr.Synthesis of Dense Silica Nanoparticles (dSiO2)Uniform 90 nm sized dSiO2 was prepared using a modified Stber method.39 In a typical synthesis, 35.7 mL of absolute ethanol was mixed with 5 mL of water and 0.8 mL of ammonia and stirred for 510 min at room temperature. One milliliter of TEOS was then added, and the mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 1 h. Afterward, dSiO2 nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation (at 12500g for 10 min), washed with water/ethanol three times, and resuspended in 20 mL of water before use.Synthesis of Mesoporous Silica NanoparticlesA previously reported biphase stratification approach with slight modifications was used for the synthesis of MSN with varied pore sizes.28 In a typical synthesis of 150 nm sized MSN with 45 nm pore size, 24 mL of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 25 wt %) solution and 0.18 g of triethylamine (TEA) were added to 36 mL of water and stirred gently at 60 C for 3 h in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. Twenty milliliters of (20% v/v) TEOS in cyclohexane was carefully added to the waterCTACTEA solution and kept at 60 C in a water bath for 12 h (stirring rate was set to 125 rpm). Afterward, milky white samples were collected by centrifugation (at 12500g for 10 min), which were subjected to the CTAC removal process by stirring in 1 wt % NaCl/methanol solution three times (24 h/time). Complete removal of CTAC was demonstrated by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.For the synthesis of MSN with 910 nm pore size, the upper organic layer was replaced with 20 mL of (5% v/v) TEOS in cyclohexane. The mixture was reacted at 60 C in a water bath for 60 h before the CTAC removal process.Chelator-Free 89Zr Labeling Using dSiO2For 89Zr labeling, 250 L of dSiO2 (concentration range: 2 mg/mL to 2 104 mg/mL) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.5, 0.1 M) was directly mixed with 3 mCi (or 111 MBq) of 89Zr-oxalate at 37 C (or 75 C). The final pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 78 by using 2 M Na2CO3. 89Zr labeling yield was monitored and quantified at different time points (from 30 min to 2 h) by using thin layer chromatography (TLC). 89Zr-dSiO2 could be easily collected by centrifugation (at 21000g for 10 min).Chelator-Free 89Zr Labeling Using MSNFor 89Zr labeling, 250 L of MSN (concentration range: 2 mg/mL to 2 104 mg/mL) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.5, 0.1 M) was simply mixed with 3 mCi (or 111 MBq) of 89Zr-oxalate at 37 C (or 75 C). The final pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 78 by using 2 M Na2CO3. 89Zr labeling yield was monitored and quantified at different time points (from 30 min to 2 h) by using radio-TLC. 89Zr-MSN could be easily collected by centrifugation (at 21000g for 10 min).DFO Challenge StudyTo demonstrate the stability of 89Zr in MSN and dSiO2, DFO-Bz-NCS (p-isothiocyanatobenzyl desferrioxamine B) with varied concentrations was added into 250 L of 89Zr-MSN (200 Ci) or 89Zr-dSiO2 (200 Ci) HEPES solution (pH 78) at 37 C under constant shaking (550 rpm) for 48 h. The final DFO concentrations were fixed to be 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mM. At each time point, 10 L of mixture was taken out and resuspended in 200 L of HEPES. A 100 kDa filter was used to separate potential 89Zr-DFO from 89Zr-labeled nanoparticles. The 89Zr-DFO radio-activity was measured by using a gamma counter (PerkinElmer).EDTA Challenge StudyTo further demonstrate the radio-stability of 89Zr in MSN, as-synthesized 89Zr-MSN was soaked in 1 mM EDTA and kept at 37 C under constant shaking (550 rpm) for 1 week. Both free 89Zr and 89Zr-MSN were monitored and quantified at different time points (from day 1 to day 7) by using radio-TLC. 89Zr-EDTA migrates along the iTLC strip, while 89Zr-MSN remains at the origin.Loading MSN and 89Zr-MSN with Hydrophilic Anticancer DrugsDoxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was selected as the model drug to test the drug loading capacity of MSN before and after 89Zr labeling. MSN (size: 150 nm; surface area: 581.5 m2/g; pore volume: 1.31 cm3/g) with a known mass (0.5 mg) was resuspended in 1 mL (0.5 mg/mL) of DOX-PBS solution (total amount of DOX was 0.5 mg). The mixture was kept under constant shaking for 48 h at room temperature. Afterward, MSN(DOX) was collected by centrifugation (at 21000g for 10 min) and washed with PBS three times. All DOX in the supernatant was carefully collected and quantified based on the DOX (in PBS solution) standard curve. The loading capacity was calculated by the following equation:To load DOX into 89Zr-MSN, the same amount of MSN (0.5 mg) was first labeled with 89Zr as described previously and then went through the same drug loading process as MSN(DOX). More details about the drug loading can be found in Table S4.In Vitro Serum Stability StudyTo study the in vitro serum stability of both 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSN, 50 L of 89Zr-MSN (or 89Zr-dSiO2) was mixed with 50 L of 2x whole mouse serum at 37 C under constant shaking (550 rpm) for 48 h. At each time point, a small fraction of the mixture (15 L) was collected, resuspended in 100 L of PBS, and purified by using a 100 kDa filter. The 89Zr activity of the filtrate and that retained in the filter was measured by using a gamma counter.In Vivo PET Imaging of 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSNFor in vivo PET imaging, 150 L (400 Ci or 14.8 MBq) of 89Zr-MSN (or 89Zr-dSiO2) in water was i.v. injected into healthy BALB/c mice (n = 3). PET scans at various time points p.i., from 0.5 h to 21 days, were performed by using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.). The images were reconstructed using a maximum a posteriori algorithm, with no scatter correction. ROI analysis of each PET scan was performed using vendor software (Inveon Research Workplace [IRW]) on decay-corrected whole-body images, as we described previously,40 to calculate the percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) values in mouse liver and bone.Ex Vivo Biodistribution of 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSNBiodistribution studies were also carried out to confirm that the quantitative uptake values based on PET imaging truly represented the radio-activity distribution in mice. After the last in vivo PET imaging on day 21 p.i., all major organs/tissues were collected and wet-weighed. The radio-activity in the tissue was measured using a gamma counter and presented as %ID/g.CharacterizationsTransmission electron microscopy images were obtained on a FEI T12 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Standard TEM samples were prepared by dropping dilute products onto carbon-coated copper grids. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 system.

The lethal dose, 50 (LD50), of intravenously administrated SNPs was calculated in mice using Dixon's up-and-down method (262.4533.78 mg/kg). The acute toxicity was evaluated at 14 d after intravenous injection of SNPs at 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg in mice. A silicon content analysis using ICP-OES found that SNPs mainly distributed in the resident macrophages of the liver (10.24%ID/g), spleen (34.78%ID/g) and lung (1.96%ID/g). TEM imaging showed only a small amount in the hepatocytes of the liver and in the capillary endothelial cells of the lung and kidney. The levels of serum LDH, AST and ALT were all elevated in the SNP treated groups. A histological examination showed lymphocytic infiltration, granuloma formation, and hydropic degeneration in liver hepatocytes; megakaryocyte hyperplasia in the spleen; and pneumonemia and pulmonary interstitial thickening in the lung of the SNP treated groups. A CD68 immunohistochemistry stain indicated SNPs induced macrophage proliferation in the liver and spleen. The results suggest injuries induced by the SNPs in the liver, spleen and lungs. Mononuclear phagocytic cells played an important role in the injury process.This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81230065, No. 81172704), http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/Portal0/default152.htm; Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development of Beijing Education Committee (PHR201006110) and Innovative Team Project of Beijing Education Committee (PHR201107116), http://www.bjedu.gov.cn/publish/portal0/tab40/.

Amorphous silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are one of the most common nanomaterials and because of their favorable physico-chemical properties, they are being applied increasingly more in industrial manufacturing, high-molecule composite materials, cosmetics, and foodstuffs [1]. Because of their high hydrophilicity, good biocompatibility, easy surface modification and labeling, silica nanoparticles are being developed for a host of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications such as drug delivery, cancer therapy, imaging probes, biosensors and enzyme immobilization [2], [3]. Human exposure to the SNPs is increasing; therefore, the evaluation of the toxicity of these nanoparticles is urgently needed.To date, the results of a growing number of in vitro studies have shown that the cytotoxicity induced by amorphous SNPs is dose-, time-, size- and cell line-dependent [4], [5], [6]. SNPs can enter cells through different routes and then distribute in the cytoplasm and nucleus [7], [8]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation has been considered as a mechanism involved in the toxic effect of SNPs [9], [10]. As reported, SNP exposure leads to an oxidative stress and inflammation response in various cell lines followed by cell membrane damage, DNA strand breaks, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell cycle arrest, necrosis and apoptosis [6], [11], [12]. However, in vivo toxicity of SNPs has been studied far less than in vitro toxicity [3].Inhalation is a common route for exposure to nanomaterials. Thus, much research has been performed on the pulmonary toxicity caused by amorphous SNPs. Animal inhalation studies indicate that exposure to SNPs results in transient changes in breathing parameters, increased lung weight, total bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and proteins, induced acute inflammation and tissue damage [13], [14], [15].In recent years, because of the application of SNPs to biomedicine and biotechnology, intravenous exposure to SNPs has become common, but little research has been carried out to assess the toxicity of intravenous SNP exposure [16], [17], [18] and there is still no uniform standard for determining the toxicity of nanomaterials entering the blood stream [19]. The acute toxicity studies that have been done on intravenous SNP exposure are limited and far from comprehensive. Additionally, there is no available LD50 for SNPs for toxicity grading. Acute toxicity research is the first step to understand the toxic effects of chemicals on organisms, to provide a basis for subsequent subchronic and chronic toxicity study. Thus, it has become important to clearly indentify the acute toxicity of SNPs.In the present study, we systematically evaluated the acute toxicity in mice of intravenously injected 64 nm SNPs in order to provide experimental evidence for the evaluation of the toxicity of silica nanomaterials. The LD50 of SNPs in ICR mice was estimated for the first time using Dixon's up-and-down method. Dead animals from this experiment were sent for an immediate necropsy to identify the cause of death. Then, for acute toxicity research, a series of doses were set based on the LD50. The silicon content of tissues was determined by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Blood biochemical assay, morphological and histopathological examination and TEM imaging were used to investigate the adverse effects of SNPs on major organs.Materials and MethodsSilica nanoparticlesThe amorphous SNPs (12 g/L mass concentration) were provided by the school of chemistry at Jilin University. The shape and average size of the particles were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Japan). A Zeta electric potential granulometer (Malvern, Britain) was employed to examine the Zeta potential and hydrodynamic sizes of silica particles in dispersion media.Detection of endotoxinGel clot Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay was used to detect the endotoxin in SNP suspensions at concentrations of 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 mg/ml. The gel clot LAL reagents including endotoxin standard, LAL water, and lysate were purchased from Zhan Jiang Bokang Marine Biological Co., LTD. The detection limit was less than 0.125 EU/ml.AnimalsMale and female ICR mice (8 weeks old and 2022 g in weight) were purchased from Weitong-Lihua Experimental Animal Center (Beijing, China). They were separated by sex in plastic cages with stainless steel mesh lids in a ventilated room. The room was maintained at 202 C and 6010% relative humidity with a 12 h light-dark cycle. The mice were given water and sterilized food. Prior to treatment, the mice were not fed overnight. All animal care and experimentations were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at Capital Medical University (approval number 2011-X-072).LD50 Estimation using Dixon's Up-and-Down MethodLD50 was estimated using the up-and-down method [20] as described by Dixon, which uses an iterative dose-selection algorithm. The maximum likelihood estimate for LD50 with SE was calculated using the following formula: LD50=average (Xi)+d/N(A+C). Average (Xi) is the average experimental dose for the last N samples, N is the nominal number of samples or total number of samples, minus 1 less than the number of identical samples at the beginning of the trial, A and C values are acquired from Dixon's tables after the series of experiments are performed, and d is the distance between data points [21]. The method assumes that the SD, , is equal to the spacing distance. However, Dixon also gives a method to calculate SE=square root of (2/N). Mortality in this LD50 estimating study was recorded and the bodies were sent for an immediate necropsy.Silicon content and tissue distributionTo determine the silicon content in the tissues, samples from the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain were collected. The wet samples were weighed and digested with nitric acid by microwave heating, and then the silicon content was analyzed using ICP-OES (Optima 7000DV, PerkinElmer, US).Acute toxicityFor the SNP acute toxicity study a series of doses were set based on an LD50 estimating study. A total of 40 mice of either sex were exposed to 0, 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg of SNPs. An SNP suspension in physiological saline was injected through the mouse tail vein. Injections of sterile physiological saline were also given to the mice as a control. After the injection, symptoms and mortality were observed and carefully recorded throughout the entire experiment. At the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed for subsequent experimental study.Body weight and coefficients of organsAfter exposure to the different doses of SNPs, the mice were weighed on days 1 and 14. On day 14 after the injection, the mice were sacrificed and the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidneys and brain were excised and accurately weighed. The coefficients of these organs to body weight were calculated as the ratio of tissues (wet weight) to body weight.Blood biochemical assayBlood samples were collected via the ocular vein. The serum was obtained by centrifugation of the whole blood at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. Liver function was evaluated based on the serum levels of aspartate minotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Albumin (ALB). Nephrotoxicity was reflected by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr). The enzyme of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured to evaluate cell membrane injury and tissue damage. These biochemical parameters were determined by an automated biochemical analyzer (Type 7200-202, Hitachi, Japan).Histopathological ExaminationThe liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung and brain were removed and fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for histological examination using standard techniques. In order to confirm the cause of death, the sections of the lungs in the dead mice were stained for fibrin with Martius Scarlet Blue (MSB) according to routine procedures. After staining, the slides were observed and examined by optical microscope (Olympus X71-F22PH, Japan). The pathologist was blind to the identity and analysis of the pathology slides. For quantification, the total number and size of granulomas in 30 optical fields (200 magnification) of each liver section, and the number of megakaryocytes in 50 optical fields (400 magnification) of each spleen section were determined using an Olympus software (cellSens Standard). The fields were chosen randomly and continuously. Data were presented as mean SD of five mice of each group.ImmunohistochemistryCD68 was detected immunohistochemically in the paraffin embedded liver, spleen and lung sections as a marker of macrophages. After deparaffinisation and rehydration, the sections were placed in a 10 mM citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. In order to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 5 min and then washed in PBS. Then the sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min at 37C and incubated overnight at 4C with primary antibody or an equivalent amount of normal goat IgG as a negative control. The sections were then treated with an avidin-biotin affinity system for 30 min at room temperature, washed, stained with 3-3' diaminobenzidine substrate, counter stained with hematoxylin and examined under a light microscope. Activated macrophage marker CD68 was quantified as positively stained cells per high-power field. Results were expressed as the total positive numbers from 50 random and continuous fields from each section (400 magnification).TEM imagingFor electron microscopy, the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney and brain were excised and immediately fixed overnight in 3% glutaraldehyde. Then the samples were rinsed three times with 0.1 M PB and postfixed with 1% osmic acid for 2 hours. After being rinsed three times with 0.1 M PB and serially dehydrated with 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% alcohol and 100% acetone, the samples were embedded in epoxy resin for making the blocks of tissues. The ultrathin sections (50 nm) were obtained by an ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT, Leica, Germany). They were then stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and then viewed on a TEM (JEM2100, JEOL, Japan). The pathologist was blind to the identity and analysis of the ultrathin sections.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done with SPSS (version 16.0). The average level of variables was presented as mean standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables with normal or near normal distribution. Then, parametric comparisons of continuous variables were done with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), where appropriate. Subsequently, preplanned pairwise comparison between each experimental group and control group was done. All significance tests were two-sided at level of 0.05.ResultsCharacterization of SNPsTEM and a Zeta electric potential granulometer were used to characterize the amorphous SNPs. The average size of the spherical SNPs was 64.4310.50 nm (Figure 1 and 2). The zeta potential and hydrodynamic size of the 64 nm SNPs were measured in the distilled water or physiological saline as the dispersion medium (Table 1). The SNPs had good monodispersability in distilled water (stock media) and in physiological saline (exposure media) with time (Figure 1, Table 1). The LAL assay indicated no detectable gram negative endotoxin on the SNPs at concentrations of 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 mg/ml.10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g001Figure 1TEM images of the amorphous SNPs in distilled water or physiological saline as the dispersion media.Spherical SNPs show good monodispersity in distilled water (A) and physiological saline (B).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g002Figure 2Size distribution of the amorphous SNPs.10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.t001Table 1Zeta potential and hydrodynamic size of the 64 nm SNPs in distilled water or physiological saline as the dispersion media.In distilled waterIn physiological salineTimeZeta potential (mV)Hydrodynamic size (nm)PDIZeta potential (mV)Hydrodynamic size (nm)PDI10 min42.7108.30.11639.2110.40.1191 h43.6107.50.11241.3111.80.1276 h46.11100.09840.7108.10.14212 h45.8109.10.08438.3108.80.14124 h43.2107.30.10943.8107.80.136LD50 To obtain the LD50 of 64 nm SNPs in ICR mice, doses and intervals were designed according to the Dixon up-and-down method. After acclimatization to the environment, the mice were exposed to the SNPs with the doses shown in Figure 3. The first animal received a dose one step below the assumed estimate of the LD50. If the animal survived, the second animal received a higher dose. If the first animal died, the second animal received a lower dose. Each subsequent dosage was raised or lowered based on the survival of the preceding animal. The mortality in each dose group was observed and recorded. The LD50 of 64 nm SNPs was calculated using the formula provided by Dixon's up-and-down method (LD50=262.4533.78 mg/kg).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g003Figure 3Up-and-down experimental series.The test was started with an initial dose of 103.5 mg/kg, and an interval of doses of 74 mg/kg. O=survival to 48 h; X=death within 48 h.In this experiment, the symptoms and mortality of the treated mice were observed and recorded. Dead animals were sent for an immediate necropsy. As shown in Figure 3, three mice were injected with the SNPs at 325.5 mg/kg, and they all died in 45 hours after injection; five mice were injected with the SNPs at 251.5 mg/kg, two of them died in 8 hours after administration. The mice showed obvious symptoms of labored breathing, tremor, arching, cyanosis, hypothermia, difficulty in movement and sleepiness. In the gross anatomical examination, the liver, spleen, lung and kidney showed obvious swelling and hyperemia, and the capillary networks of the liver and spleen were clearly visible. Serious hepatic necrosis, remarkable central vein dilatation and congestion in the liver and pink microthrombi widely distributed in the pulmonary arterioles were observed in the pathological examination of the dead mice (Figure 4A and 4B). Megakaryocyte accumulation, increased size of red pulp in the spleen, and renal interstitium hyperemia was demonstrated in the pathological examination (Figure 4C and 4D). The red homogeneity fibrin thrombi were observed in the pulmonary arterioles in the sections of the lungs by the MSB staining (Figure 4E).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g004Figure 4Histological analysis of the main organs in the dead mice.Representative pictures from HE staining sections of the liver (A), lung (B), spleen (C), and kidney (D) and MSB staining sections of the lungs (E) in dead mice.

Green arrows denote the red fibrin thrombi in the lungs. The magnification was 400 for A, C and E, 200for B and D. Data are representative of 5 mice.Silicon content and tissue distributionAn analysis of the silicon content in different viscera in the SNP treated mice at 177.5 mg/kg by ICP-OES revealed that the silicon content varied in different tissues. SNPs mainly distributed or accumulated in the tissues enriched with the monocyte phagocyte system (MPS), like the liver and spleen, but not in the lung. At 14 days following the injection, about 12.67% of the injected SNPs localized in the liver and 34.78% in the spleen, while only 1.96% localized in the lung. Very little silicon was detected in the heart, kidney and brain (Figure 5). About 52.04% of the injected SNPs still remained in the body at day 14, possibly requiring a longer period for complete clearance.10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g005Figure 5ICP-OES analysis result of the silicon levels.The silicon content was analyzed in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain in the SNP treated mice at 177.5 mg/kg. Data are expressed as mean SD (n=9).Acute toxicity studyVital signsThe experimental protocol for the acute toxicity study is shown in Figure 6. During the entire study period, no unusual behavior was observed in the control and 29.5 mg/kg treated groups. A few animals showed temporary labored breathing and cyanosis in the 103.5 mg/kg treated group. In the 177.5 mg/kg treated group, one male animal died at 6 h after injection. During the observation period, labored breathing, cyanosis and difficulty in movement were observed. Interestingly, seven mice in the 177.5 mg/kg treated group developed progressive tail ischemic necrosis and at day 14 only 23 cm of the tail remained. In the 103.5 mg/kg treated group, only two mice developed a slight tail ischemic necrosis (about 0.5 cm). No changes were observed in the control and 29.5 mg/kg treated groups.10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g006Figure 6Experimental design of acute toxicity of the SNPs in ICR mice.Body weight and coefficients of organsAfter the 14 d observation period, the mice were weighed and sacrificed. Major tissues and organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, lung and brain were excised and accurately weighed. The weight gain decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the SNP treated mice (Figure 7). No obvious differences were found in the weight gain between the control and the three treated groups (Figure 7). The coefficient of liver was obviously increased in the highest treated group, and the coefficient of spleen was significantly higher in the 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg treated groups than in the control group (p0.05). The coefficient of lung increased slightly in the three SNP treated groups. No significant difference was observed in the other tissues and organs (Figure 8).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g007Figure 7Weight gain of mice treated with the SNPs.The SNPs were intravenously administered to mice at 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg. Mice were weighed on days 1 and 14 after injection. The weight gain decreased in a dose-dependent manner in SNP treated mice, but with no significant difference compared with control group. Data are expressed as mean SD (n=9 or 10). ANCOVA was used for the data analysis.10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g008Figure 8Coefficient of liver and spleen of the mice treated with the SNPs.Data are expressed as mean SD (n=9 or 10). * p0.05 compared with control group using ANOVA.Blood biochemical parametersThe results from the blood biochemical examination indicated that the liver could be a target organ for SNPs. The LDH level was significantly higher in the three treated groups than in the control group (p0.05), indicating cell membrane injury and tissue damage in the treated mice. The ALT level was elevated in a dose dependent manner and was significantly higher in the 177.5 mg/kg treated group than in the control group (p0.05). A slight elevation of serum AST was observed in the three SNP treated groups, but there were no obvious changes in serum ALB. No elevation of BUN and Cr, biochemical markers of kidney damage, were observed (Figure 9).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g009Figure 9Biochemical analyses in the serum of the mice treated with the SNPs.The SNPs were intravenously administered to mice at 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg. The serum levels of LDH, ALB, AST, ALT, TBIL, BUN and Cr were detected. Data are expressed as mean SD (n=9 or 10). * p0.05 compared with control group using ANOVA.Pathological examinationIn the control group, liver sections showed normal hepatic cells with complete cytoplasm as well as intact nucleus, nucleolus and central vein (Figure 10A). Lymphocytic infiltration, granuloma formation and hydropic degeneration in the hepatocytes were observed in the livers of the 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg SNP treated mice indicating that the SNPs may be hepatotoxic. Multiple Kupper cells (KCs) were obviously visible disintegrating in the granuloma of the 177.5 mg/kg treated group (Figure 10A). The numbers and sizes of granulomas in the liver increased in a dose-dependent manner in the SNP treated groups (Figure 10B and C). Megakaryocyte hyperplasia was present in the red pulp in the spleen of the SNP treated mice (Figure 11A), and the number of megakaryocytes in the spleen of the SNP treated mice was elevated 0.38 to 1.07 fold more than contol values (Figure11B). Pulmanory hyperemia and pulmonary interstitial thickening were observed in the lungs of the SNP treated mice (Figure 12). The other viscera including the heart, kidney and brain did not show significant changes in morphology in the SNP treated mice (Figure 13).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g010Figure 10Histological analyses of the liver in the SNP treated mice.(A) Representative liver sections taken from the control mice, 29.5 mg/kg, 103.5 mg/kg and 177.5 mg/kg administered mice at 400 magnification.

Heart, lung and kidney sections were observed under a microscope at 400 magnification, and brain sections were observed at 100 magnification. Data are representative of at least eight mice.Immunohistochemistry stain of CD68To further investigate the role of macrophages in pathological changes in the liver, spleen and lung, we performed an immunohistochemistry stain of CD68 in the sections of these organs. In the control group, CD68 positive cells mainly located in the hepatic sinusoid in the liver, whereas strong positive signals for CD68 were found in the hepatic granulomas of the SNP treated mice (Figure 14A). Administration of SNPs at 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg significantly elevated the number of CD68 positive cells in the liver to 1.54 and 1.98 fold more than control values (Figure 14B). The results indicated that the granuloma may result from the fusion of several separated KCs. In the spleen, CD68 positive cells accumulated in the splenic sinus of both the control mice and the SNP treated mice (Figure 15A). But the number of CD68 positive cells in the spleen was significantly greater in the SNP treated mice than in the control mice (Figure 15B). The association between the number of CD68 positive cells in the liver or spleen and SNP exposure was found to be dose-dependent. In the lung, CD68 positive cells mainly localized in the pulmonary interstitial or the alveolar space in the control and 29.5 mg/kg treated mice (Figure 16A). Positive signals for CD68 expression were also observed in suspected granuloma occasionally found in the lung sections of the 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg treated mice (Figure 16A). But only in the 177.5 mg/kg group did the number of CD68 positive cells increase significantly more than that of the control group (Figure 16B).10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g014Figure 14Immunohistochemistry stain of CD68 in the liver.(A) Representative liver sections taken from control mice and 29.5 mg/kg, 103.5 mg/kg and 177.5 mg/kg administered mice at 400 magnification.

Data are representative of at least six mice.TEM imagingIn order to confirm the subcellular distribution of SNPs in major tissues, TEM imaging was performed in the 177.5 mg/kg SNP treated mice. SNPs were observed in the resident macrophages in the liver, lung and spleen (Figure 17A, C and E). However, a limited amount of SNPs was found trapped in the hepatocytes in the liver, in the pulmonary capillary endothelial cells in the lung, or in the glomerulus capillary endothelial cells in the kidney (Figure 17B, D and F). The SNPs in the heart were observed only in the myocardial interstitium; none were found in the capillary endothelial cells or in the cardiac myocyte (Figure 17G). The SNPs found in the tissues appeared to aggregate into clumps, enveloped by a lysosomal membrane and without any obvious change of size or shape (Figure 17). No SNPs were found in the TEM samples from the brain.10.1371/journal.pone.0061346.g017Figure 17TEM images of the liver, lung, spleen, kidney and heart from the 177.5 mg/kg treated mice.

In the present study, we estimated the LD50 of 64 nm amorphous SNPs through intravenous administration in mice to be 262.4533.78 mg/kg using the Dixon up-and-down method. Based on the result of the LD50, we set a series of doses with equal intervals at 29.5, 103.5, and 177.5 mg/kg to investigate the acute toxicity of SNPs. The results revealed elevated biochemical indexes including LDH, AST and ALT in the SNP treated groups. The histopathology examination indicated lymphocytic infiltration, granuloma formation, and hydropic degeneration in the hepatocytes of the liver. The number of megakaryocytes increased in the spleen and pulmanory hyperemia and interstitial thickening was discovered in the lung by the histological examination. A CD68 immunohistochemistry stain indicated the SNPs induced macrophage proliferation in the liver and spleen.Our study may contibute to the evaluation of the safety of SNPs in biomedical and pharmacological applications. To date, this is the first study to report the calculated LD50 of intravenously administrated amorphous spherical SNPs in mice using a toxicological method. The LD50 of 70 nm SNPs administrated by bolus injection in mice has been reported as 45 mg/kg. Possibly, a rapid bolus injection, which is commonly used in medical imaging, may make the 70 nm SNPs more toxic. In addition, the different strains of mouse models and the difference in LD50 evaluation methods could also contribute to the different values of LD50 obtained in these two studies. [22]. Traditional LD50 determinations use multiple animals at 57 defined dose intervals; however, the Dixon up-and-down method used in our study reduces the number of animals required to estimate LD50 values. During the procedure, the intravenous injection of the SNPs at 325.5 mg/kg was often lethal (Figure 3). The histopathology examination afterwards revealed serious hepatic necrosis, pulmonary microthrombi, hyperemia and haemorrhage in the main organs of the dead mice. An early study by Movat et al. demonstrated that nanoparticles could lead to platelet activation and aggregation [23]. Recently, Nabeshi et al. reported that the interaction between the SNPs and the instinct coagulation factors XII induced platelet depletion and consumptive coagulopathy after systemic exposure [22]. Coincidentally, we observed progressive tail ischemic necrosis in the 177.5 mg/kg group of this subsequent study, which might be ascribed to the microthrombi formation in the local blood vessels induced by the SNPs. Thus, we hypothesized that when a large amount of SNPs entered the bloodstream they might induce platelet activation and aggregation and then disseminate intravascular coagulation (DIC), followed by wide microthrombus formation, multiple organ failure and death. Fibrin staining of the lung sections in the dead mice with MSB proved fibrin thrombi formation in the pulmonary arterioles in the lungs of the dead mice which indicated that the SNPs induced DIC and then death in the dead mice. The results of our study may provide some evidence that the thrombogenicity of the SNPs should be taken into serious consideration in the biological and pharmacological application of SNPs.The subsequent biodistribution analysis of SNPs in the 177.5 mg/kg group revealed that SNPs mainly distributed in liver (10.24%ID/g), spleen (34.78%ID/g), and lungs (1.96%ID/g). Most of the SNPs accumulated in the resident macrophages of these organs, while only a small amount distributed in the hepatocytes of the liver or in the capillary endothelial cells of the lungs and kidneys. It has been reported that the bioretention of SNPs could last more than 4 weeks after an intravenous injection [18]. However, in our study, almost 47.45% of the injected SNPs were distributed in the liver and spleen 14 days after injection, which may be attributed to the powerful scavenger and defense function for blood borne xenobiotics from MPS in these organs, which has been demonstrated by TEM imaging and CD68 immunohistochemistry stain. The results of the immunohitochemistry stain indicated that the SNPs can induce macrophage activation and proliferation in the liver and spleen, thus leading to the injury in these organs.One of the most important histological observations in the liver was the presence of hepatic granuloma formation. Granuloma formation initiates from phagocytosis of the macrophage. The macrophage engulfs xenobiotics such as SNPs, which is followed by inflammatory cytokines and the release of chemokines and results in oxidative stress and cell damage as reported by Park et al. both in peritoneal macrophage and the RAW264.7 cell line [24]. In the liver, when SNPs are phagocytized by KCs, they may induce KC damage and disintegration, which is then released and taken up by other KCs. The ultimate end to this recurring reaction, with parallel lymphocytes and neutrophils recruited by the cytokines and chemokines released by KCs, is the formation of granuloma [25]. In essence, granuloma formation is an innate immune response designed to isolate xenobiotics, foreign body granuloma [26]. Granuloma induced by nanomaterials through different routes including intratracheal instillation, and intraperitoneal and intravenous injection have been reported by several research teams [17], [19], [22], [26], [27], [28], [29]. In the early phase, the granuloma consists of different kinds of cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, but in the late phase, the granuloma turn into fibrosis, which has been observed in our on-going work. Fibrosis granuloma in the liver is caused by repeated intravenous administration of SNPs and occurs for a longer period; research into the mechanism is under way.As the main filter and store of blood, it follows that the spleen becomes the largest holder of SNPs. TEM imaging and the CD68 immunohistochemistry stain revealed that marophages played an important role in the retention of SNPs in the spleen. In our study, histological hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in the red pulp of the spleen was observed in SNP treated mice, indicating splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is associated with pathological conditions [30], [31], [32], [33]. Kwon et al. demonstrated that inhaled fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles induced extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen of mice without pulmonary abnormalities [34]. However, the mechanism behind nanoparticle induced extramedullary hematopoiesis is still not clear. The long retention of SNPs in the spleen may impact the splenic immune function. Park et al. demonstrated that SNPs decreased splenic cell viability, and induced phenotypic alterations of lymphocytes derived from the spleen after intraperitoneal injection [24]. Taken together, the toxicity and the mechanism induced by SNPs in the hemopoietic system and the immune system need to be clarified. A group of colleagues from our team are working on the related research.In our study, we also observed changes in several biochemical indexes. An elevated serum LDH in the SNP treated groups indicated cell membrane destruction in the main organs, which was probably induced by the distribution and retention of SNPs in the relevant cells of the main organs, as observed by TEM imaging. The serum AST and ALT levels were also raised in the SNP treated groups. This elevation illustrates the hepatocyte injuries which correlate with the histological changes of hydropic degeneration in the hepatocytes of the liver. The injuries may be attributed to two causes. First, the SNPs may induce KC released cytokines such as TNF- which could in turn induce apoptosis and necrosis of the neighboring hepatocytes [35]. Or possibly the cell injury may be caused by phagocytosis of the SNPs by the hepatocytes themselves as we observed by TEM imaging. This has also been demonstrated in SNP treated human hepatic cell line L-02 in vivo (data not published). The levels of Cr and BUN in the SNP treated groups remained normal intimating that SNP injection did not affect kidney function.This experiment was designed as a pilot study for our further research. For the first time the LD50 of 64 nm amorphous SNPs was estimated as 262.4533.78 mg/kg using the Dix up-and-down method. The subsequent gross anatomical and histological examination of the main organs of dead animals revealed that SNPs probably induced DIC related to death. So, we would like to emphasize the importance of thrombogenicity of SNPs during the application and safety evaluation. In the subsequent acute toxicity and biodistribution study, we found that during short-term systemic exposure, SNPs mainly distributed in the liver, spleen and lung and induced injury in these organs. MPS played important roles in the distribution and accumulation of SNPs as well as in the formation of tissue lesions. Further studies on the roles of MPS and the related mechanism would provide useful information for the evaluation of the safety and biological application of SNPs.The authors thank Prof. Wensheng Yang from Jilin University for the preparation of the SNPs, and Prof. Jie Dai from Capital Medical University for technical assistance in the histopathology.References1 YangX, LiuJ, HeH, ZhouL, GongC, et al (2010) SiO2 nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity and protein expression alteration in HaCaT cells.

Liposomes are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) agents that can block the RES reversibly and temporarily. With the help of positron emission tomography (PET), we monitored the in vivo tissue distribution of 64Cu-labeled 40 10 nm gold nanorods (Au NRs) after pretreatment with liposomes. We systematically studied the effectiveness of liposome administration by comparing (1) differently charged liposomes; (2) different liposome doses; and (3) varying time intervals between liposome dose and NR dose. By pre-injecting 400 mol/kg positively charged liposomes into mice 5 h before the Au NRs, the liver and spleen uptakes of Au NRs decreased by 30% and 53%, respectively. Significantly, U87MG tumor uptake of Au NRs increased from 11.5 1.1 %ID/g to 16.1 1.3 %ID/g at 27 h post-injection. Quantitative PET imaging is a valuable tool to understand the fate of NMs in vivo and cationic liposomal pretreatment is a viable approach to reduce RES clearance, prolong circulation, and improve tumor uptake.Reticuloendothelial systemNanoparticleLiposome blockadePositron Emission TomographyEnhanced tumor uptake.IntroductionThe surge of nanotechnology has led to notable advancements in the field of oncology 1-3. Nanomaterials (NMs), with large surface areas, unique properties, and tunable signal outputs, are great candidates for cancer theranostics 4-5. Unlike small molecules, NMs can passively target solid tumor tissue due to the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect 6-7. After intravenous administration, they circulate in the vascular system, preferentially penetrate into tumor tissue via leaky tumor blood vessels, and tend to retain in the tumor bed due to a lack of effective lymphatic drainage. However, many NMs can be sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and cleared rapidly from the circulation before they reach the tumor. This nonspecific sequestration not only causes a decrease in tumor-specific accumulation (a median of 0.7% of the administered NMs reach solid tumors based on a literature survey over the past 10 years 8), but also raises concerns of possible damage to RES-rich organs such as the spleen and liver 9.Many attempts have been made to minimize the sequestration of NMs by RES macrophages. One approach is to optimize the physicochemical properties of NMs such as size, charge, and surface coating 10-12. However, this approach may attenuate their original signal output and tumor targeting capabilities. For example, although PEGylated ultrasmall silica NMs are renally cleared with low RES accumulation, the tumor targeting efficiency is only around 1.0 to 1.5 %ID/g, much lower than conventional NMs 13, 14.Another approach is to preemptively suppress RES macrophage activity. A variety of materials that are toxic to macrophages including dextran sulfate 500, methyl palmitate, and gadolinium chloride have been pre-injected into mice to deplete macrophages in order to increase the blood circulation of a secondary injection of NMs 15-18. Nevertheless, the possibility of systemic toxicity for these agents is of great concern.Liposomes as drug carriers have been used as Trojan horses to help deliver these suppressors specifically into macrophages 19-21. Meanwhile, it has been found that pre-injection of empty liposomes may saturate macrophages reversibly, and thus decrease liver uptake of a subsequent dose of similar vesicles with little to no side effect on the liver function 22. Since the RES clearance process of inorganic particles resembles the clearance route of liposomes, the RES blockade phenomenon induced by pre-administration of empty liposomes may also be applicable to inorganic NMs. However, considering its controversial effectiveness, the liposome based RES blockade strategy has not been extensively explored for other NMs. In a recent study, this approach has successfully decreased subsequent RES uptake of 25 nm iron oxide nanoclusters and resulted in a near 2-fold enhancement of MRI signal in the tumor area 23. Although this study provided visible evidence of the benefits, it is still unclear how this strategy could affect the tissue distribution of a subsequent dose of NMs. It is thus highly desirable to obtain detailed information on the comparative pharmacokinetics and distribution of NMs with and without this approach, as this will guide future design and optimization of dosing strategies for maximal tumor enrichment of NMs.In this study, we pre-administered empty liposomes to reduce RES clearance in an effort to improve the tumor uptake of a second dose of gold nanorods (Au NRs). Au NRs are one of the most widely used NMs in the theranostic field 24. A recently developed direct 64Cu labeling method, without the need for macrocyclic chelator, was utilized in our study 25, 26. With the help of 64Cu based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, Au NR distribution can be monitored continuously and noninvasively. We thoroughly investigated the effect of liposome administration including: (1) injection of liposomes with different charges; (2) variation of liposome dose; (3) modulation of the time interval between liposome dose and NR dose. After optimizing the procedure for pre-injection of liposomes, the liver and spleen uptake of the second Au NR dose successfully decreased by 30% and 53% respectively, while the tumor uptake increased by 50%.Materials and MethodsChemicals and Materials1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). Au NRs (40 10 nm) were purchased from Nanopartz (Loveland, CO, USA). Poly(ethyleneglycol)-thiol (MW 5000 g/mol) was purchased from Nanocs (New York, NY, USA). 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic acid (DOTA) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Ascorbic acid was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 64Cu was produced by the PET Department, NIH (Bethesda, MD, UA). Deionized (DI) water with a resistivity of 18.0 M was obtained from a Millipore Autopure system (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).InstrumentsTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed on a FEI Tecnai 12 (120 kV). The samples were prepared by depositing a diluted dispersion of liposomes on carbon-coated copper grids, absorbing excess liquid with blotting paper. The hydrodynamic size of liposomes was measured by a Zetasizer Nano series (Zen3600, Malvern). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was performed on a JY2000 Ultrace ICP atomic emission spectrometer equipped with a JYAS421 auto sampler and 2400 g/mm holographic grating. PET scans were performed using an Inveon PET scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions).Preparation of liposomes and 64Cu labeled liposomesThe liposomes were prepared according to a method reported previously.28 Briefly, a lipid mixture was evaporated and dried to a thin film overnight. The lipid film was then hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature with sonication. The solution was then extruded through a polycarbonate filter of 200 nm pore size.64Cu labeling was performed by modifying a reported method.33 DOTA was used as a metal chelator and was encapsulated into liposomes during the hydration process. The residual DOTA was removed via dialysis. The 64CuCl2 was first added into 2-hydroxyquinoline/HEPES buffer. The DOTA-containing liposomes were then added. After incubation at 25 C for 1 h, the free 64Cu was separated from the 64Cu loaded liposome by centrifugal filtration. The labeling efficiency was calculated by instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) plates with citric acid (0.1 M pH 5) as an eluent. The labeling efficiency was nearly 80%.Preparation of 64Cu-labeled Au NRsAu NRs were modified with SH-PEG-NH2. The 64Cu labeling was carried out following a modified method.25 Briefly, 64CuCl2 was pre-mixed with sodium ascorbate buffer and vortexed. Au NRs were then added and shaken at 37 C for 1 h. The resulting 64Cu labeled Au NRs were purified by centrifugal filtration. The labeling efficiency was nearly 100%.Cell Culture and Animal ModelThe U87MG human glioblastoma cells were cultured in MEM medium (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The RAW 264.7 cells were grown in DMEM medium (Invitrogen). All cell culture media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). All cells were grown at 37 C under 5% CO2. Athymic nude mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and were subcutaneously implanted with 5 106 U87MG cells on the right shoulder. The imaging studies were performed 3 weeks after inoculation. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper.Cell cycles and cell toxicityThe cell viability of different liposomes on RAW cells was estimated by the standard MTT assay using the untreated group as a control. Briefly, the RAW cells were seeded into 96-well plates (104 cells per well) overnight. Liposomes were incubated with cells for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS before 10 L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added. The plate was incubated for another 4 h and washed 100 L of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured by a plate reader. The flow cytometric analysis was performed following a standard protocol. Briefly, 10 M liposomes were incubated with RAW cells for 24 h before cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, harvested, and centrifuged. The cells were incubated with 5 L of 2 mg mL-1 RNase for 1 h, followed by staining with 75 L propidium iodide (PI, 1 mg mL-1) for 15 min. Measurement was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) with 488 nm excitation. The data were analyzed by FlowJo version 7.6.5 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).PET StudiesTumor-bearing mice were anesthetized using isoflurane/O2 (2% v/v) and injected intravenously with 2.96-3.7 MBq (80-100 Ci) of 64Cu labeled liposome or Au NRs in a volume of 100 L PBS. PET scans at different time points for 64Cu labeled liposomes and Au NRs were obtained respectively. Reconstruction of PET images was done without correction for attenuation or scatter using a 3-D ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm. Image analysis was performed by ASI Pro VMTM software. Regions of interest were drawn on the coronal images to calculate %ID/g, assuming a density of 1 for all tissues.Ex vivo histological stainingTissues were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution at room temperature. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (by BBC Biochemical, Mount Vernon, WA, USA) was observed on a BX41 bright field microscopy (Olympus, Waltham, MA, USA).Statistical AnalysisResults were presented as mean standard deviation (SD). Group comparisons were made using Student's t test for unpaired data. P values 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results and DiscussionInfluence of liposomes on cellular uptake of Au NRsIt is well-known that liposomes with diameters larger than 200 nm have high RES uptake and therefore should exhibit good RES blockade effect 6, 27. However, there is still no consensus on how the surface charges of liposomes affect RES blocking efficiency.Thus, we prepared liposomes around 200 nm with different surface charges. The liposomes were synthesized via a thin film hydration method, followed by several rounds of extrusion 28. The surface charge was controlled by adjusting the lipid composition: 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)/cholesterol (CHOL) (8:2) for uncharged (neutral) liposomes, DPPC/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG)/CHOL (7:1:2) for negative liposomes, and DPPC/1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DPTAP)/ CHOL (7:1:2) for positive liposomes. As shown in Figure 1, all three kinds of liposomes have similar morphology and hydrodynamic size (189.9 1.0, 195.1 1.7 and 194.4 1.4 nm, respectively), whereas the zeta potential measurement demonstrated that they were uncharged (0 1.8 mV), negative (-78.1 2.2 mV), or positive (57.5 1.7 mV).The cytotoxicity of all three kinds of liposomes on a common mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was assessed to confirm their biocompatibility. At 10 M liposome, no significant toxicity was observed after 24 h (Figure 2A). The flow cytometry analysis further confirmed that 10 M liposomes, whether positive, negative, or neutral, have negligible influence on the cell cycle (Figure 2B). This is consistent with previous observations that liposome-mediated RES blockade does not damage the macrophages or impair liver function 23, 29.We further investigated the influence of liposomes on the cellular uptake of Au NRs. It has been reported that liposomes can affect the second dose of NMs in two ways: 1) The liposomes can saturate the receptors on macrophages for foreign particle recognition 30, 31; 2) The liposomes can deplete the opsonins from plasma, which is important for macrophages to recognize and engulf foreign particles 32. Thus far, there has been virtually no quantitative study on the extent to which the liposome blockade can decrease cellular uptake of a secondary dose of NMs. We compared the blockade effect of liposomes with different charges at the same dose (10 M) and the same time interval (5 h). Briefly, we first treated RAW 264.7 cells with 10 M liposomes, followed by Au NRs 5 h later. The cellular uptake of Au NRs was quantified after 24 h incubation via inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurement. As shown in Figure 2C, all three kinds of liposomes demonstrated blockade effects, while the positive liposomes were the most efficient ones, resulting in a dramatic decrease in cellular uptake of Au NRs from 0.270 0.005 10-7 ppm/cell to 0.141 0.005 10-7 ppm/cell. Focusing on positive liposomes, we then further studied the blockade effect at different time intervals (1 and 5 h) and with various liposome doses (1, 5 and 10 M). Figure 2D demonstrated that 10 M positive liposomes only slightly blocked the macrophage uptake of Au NRs with a 1 h interval, but could effectively decrease the macrophage uptake to 50% with a 5 h interval. This result indicates the time dependent nature of liposomes to either saturate the receptors on macrophages or to deplete the opsonins. The blockade effect is also liposome concentration dependent. As the liposome dose increased from 1 M to 5 M, the blockade efficiency increased from 12% to 41%. However, further increasing the concentration to 10 M did not further reduce cellular uptake of Au NRs. It might be reasoned that 5 M is sufficient for receptor saturation and opsonin depletion.In vivo behavior of liposomesAt the cellular level, positive liposomes exhibited the best macrophage blocking effect. To better predict the in vivo blockade effect, we then studied the in vivo biodistribution of different liposomes, emphasizing the liver and spleen where the macrophages mainly reside. 64Cu-based PET imaging was used to monitor the distribution of liposomes over time. PET imaging permits non-invasive, direct, and quantitative measurement of specific regions of interest (ROIs) with high sensitivity, and thus is one of the best approaches to study the biodistribution of NMs. 64Cu is an isotope which can produce high quality PET images. Advantageously, its half-life (around 12.7 h) allows for studies even 24 h after administration. We used a method called remote loading to label liposomes with 64Cu 33. Briefly, DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triyl) triacetic acid) chelator molecules were encapsulated by liposomes. Then the lipophilic transporter (2-hydroxyquinoline) was complexed with 64Cu to form a labile complex which could enter the liposomes. Transchelation occurred upon introduction of the labile 64Cu complex to the strong hydrophilic chelator DOTA. A stable 64Cu-DOTA complex was formed, entrapped within the liposome cavity as shown in Figure 3A. This method of loading has two major advantages: 1) It can be applied to all three kinds of liposomes without the need of chemical functional groups for chelator conjugation on the surface of liposomal structure; 2) It provides high in vivo radiochemical stability with 64Cu entrapped within the inner core of liposomes. After 64Cu labeling, no obvious change in size, morphology, or zeta potential was observed.FVB mice were injected by tail vein with the same amount of 64Cu-labeled liposomes (neutral, positive, and negative) and then underwent PET scanning. It is evident from Figure 3B that most liposomes accumulated in the liver and spleen (Figure 3B) and were cleared from the blood circulation within 8 h after injection. The spleen had about 30 %ID/g uptake for all three samples at 8 h post-injection. The liver uptakes of neutral and negative liposomes were similar (around 30 %ID/g), while the positive liposomes showed much higher liver accumulation over 60 %ID/g. Our results showed that positive liposomes have the highest liver and spleen targeting ability and should be the most promising candidate for RES blockade.We then explored the in vivo blockade effect of different kinds of liposomes by quantitatively comparing the whole-body distribution of Au NRs after the blockade. Unlabeled liposomes (100 mol/kg) were injected intravenously into U87MG tumor-bearing mice and 5 h later, 64Cu-labeled Au NRs were injected. The 64Cu-Au NRs were prepared following a well-established method so that the PET signal could accurately locate Au NRs. Visual evaluation of representative whole-body PET images of mice observed slightly higher tumor uptake and less liver or spleen uptake with positive liposome blocking (Figure 4A).The detailed ROI analysis of 64Cu-Au NRs in different tissues were summarized in Figure 4B-E. Since 200 nm liposomes were cleared by the RES system and metabolized quickly, the blocking effect is transient and only effective during the first few hours as reported in other studies 29, 34. Thus, we focused our studies on the first 8 h. All three kinds of liposomes decreased liver (Figure 4C) and spleen (Figure 4D) uptake of Au NRs to some extent. Correspondingly, the amount of NRs remaining in the blood of pretreated mice increased (Figure 4B) as the RES mediated clearance reduced. The positive liposomes seemed to have the best blockade effect with the liver uptake of NRs decreased from 42.1 5.9 %ID/g to 27.1 2.2 %ID/g, spleen uptake decreased from 23.8 1.0 %ID/g to 14.0 1.0%ID/g, heart signal increased from 12.3 0.4 %ID/g to 27.2 2.2 %ID/g, and tumor uptake increased from 9.3 1.1 %ID/g to 13.6 1.6 %ID/g at 6 h post-injection. The in vivo effect of macrophage blockade was not as remarkable as that of the cellular level since the circulation, distribution, as well as metabolism of liposomes and Au NRs all influence the Au NRs' behavior after liposome blockade. Thus, direct in vivo monitoring of NMs is of great significance to elucidating the biological fate of NMs in order to guide the rational design of theranostic NMs.Uptake of Au NRs as a function of liposome dosage and time interval between liposome dose and NR doseWe further explored the effect of liposome dosage and the time interval between liposome dose and the second NR dose to optimize the blockade efficiency. Following 100 mol/kg liposome 1 h before injection of Au NRs as an example, the spleen uptake of Au NRs was around half of the unblocked group at 1 h post-injection (12.0 1.3 %ID/g vs. 24.6 1.4 %ID/g) while the liposome blockade effect on liver was not obvious until 2 h post-injection (29.3 0.6 %ID/g vs. 36.0 2.3 %ID/g). It is worth mentioning that for all the mice (both blocked and unblocked groups), the signals in the liver and spleen decreased after 20 h, probably due to the metabolism of NRs. However, the spleen uptake of the blocked group was maintained around 50% (6.6 0.4 %ID/g vs. 14.8 0.7 %ID/g) and liver uptake was around 66.7% (18.1 1.3 %ID/g vs. 27.9 2.0 %ID/g) of the unblocked group at 27 h post-injection. As liposome pretreatment successfully prevented RES clearance of the second dose of NRs, the heart signal was nearly twice that of the unblocked group (26.5 5.1 %ID/g vs. 12.3 0.4 %ID/g at 8 h post-injection.), indicating enhanced blood circulation. Although the heart signal gradually decreased to the same level at the 24 h time point (3.3 0.5 %ID/g vs. 3.1 0.8 %ID/g), the enhanced blood half-life (from 9.24 h to 14.35 h) benefited tumor accumulation (from 11.5 1.1 %ID/g to 13.4 0.5 %ID/g) (Figure S1).Figure 5 and Table 1 compared the effect of pre-injection with different doses (100, 200 and 400 mol/kg) of unlabeled liposomes on the subsequent tissue distribution of 64Cu-labeled Au NRs. The first dose of liposomes and the second dose of Au NRs were separated by 1 h and 5 h respectively (Table S1 and Table S2). It can be seen that liposomes blocked the RES activity in all the groups with a similar trend as described above. For groups with different liposome doses, there was no significant difference in the liver and spleen uptakes of Au NRs. The tumor uptakes of Au NRs were 14.9 1.4 %ID/g,15.2 1.1 %ID/g, and 16.1 1.3 %ID/g at 27 h post-injection for the 5 h pretreatment interval and 13.4 0.5 %ID/g, 13.9 0.5 %ID/g and 14.9 2.0 %ID/g for the 1 h pretreatment interval as the liposome dosage increased from 100 to 200 and 400 mol/kg, respectively. For groups with different time intervals, the liver and spleen uptakes were also similar. The tumor uptakes of Au NRs at 27 h post-injection were slightly higher with 5 h pretreatment interval than those with 1 h pretreatment interval using an equivalent dose of Au NRs. In order to exclude the possibility of detachment of 64Cu from the Au NRs, which might give false indications of Au NR localization, we further sacrificed the mice after the in vivo PET imaging study at 27 h and quantified Au amount in the tissue homogenate via ICP-AES measurement. The result (Figure 6) was consistent with that obtained from PET imaging, confirming the reliability of PET monitoring.Although we observed an obvious concentration and time interval dependent trend of the liposome blockade at the cellular level, the in vivo result did not completely follow the same trend. Taking the liposome dosage as an example, in the present work, we chose three concentrations (100, 200 and 400 mol/kg). We observed only slight increase of tumor uptake as the dosage increased at the 1 h time interval, but relatively higher tumor accumulation of Au NRs at the time interval of 5 h. It is understandable since the in vivo clearance of Au NRs is the result of many different competing processes. For instance, disassembly of liposomes could induce some changes in the physiological state of mice and therefore affect the circulation and metabolism of the following Au NR administration 35. Moreover, the dynamic evolution of the biological identity of Au NRs and liposomes during circulation may have some effect on the observed in vivo behaviors 36. In another work, liposomes at a higher concentration of 1250 mol/kg showed even less reduction in the RES clearance rate of carbon than that at 250 mol/kg. The authors claimed that the uptake of large amount of lipids could inhibit the phagocytic activity and stimulate the RES clearance of carbon 29.It is of note that at the highest dose used in the present work (400 mol/kg), liposomes had little apparent toxicity to mice with no observation of behavioral changes or weight loss. There was also no sign of damage to major organs (especially liver and spleen) based on the hematoxylin and eosin staining results (Figure S1). However, it is well known that positive liposomes could induce TNF- secretion and can exert toxicity at high concentrations. Thus, to balance the possible side effects associated with high liposome concentration with the extent of decrease in RES uptake, it seems that 100 mol/kg, within practical clinical usage parameters, is sufficient for achieving RES blockade.Liposome based RES blockade strategyAmong all the techniques that have been reported to reduce the nonspecific uptake of NMs by the liver and spleen, the liposome based RES blockade strategy has at least three advantages: first, it is a general approach to improve the circulation of NMs without altering themselves. Since the theranostic properties of NMs are highly dependent on their size, morphology, and surface chemistry 4, it is desirable to maintain their original physicochemical properties. Second, unlike most RES blockers, the effect of liposome blockade is temporary and reversible with little damage to healthy organs and generally considered as safe in the clinic. Third, the strategy is easy to handle and potentially cost and time-saving.The effect of pretreatment with liposomes on tissue distribution of a second dose of similar liposomes has been quantitatively evaluated 22, 37. It has also been reported that the same strategy worked for iron oxide nanoparticles 23 or carbon 29, evidenced by qualitative or semi-quantitative comparison. Meanwhile, several authors reported that they did not observe RES depression following a primary dose of colloid during a secondary dose of different colloid 38. They attributed this to the fact that opsonization of the first material did not necessarily cause RES depression of the second material. Although there is no conclusive evidence for this theory, we cannot ignore the possibility that liposome based blockade strategy may have different effect for different NMs. Thus, it is important to explore the liposome blockade effect on specific NMs before this strategy is actually performed.In the present work, we quantitatively investigated the effectiveness of pre-injection of liposomes to block the RES clearance of a second dose of Au NRs. We labeled liposomes and Au NRs with 64Cu and utilized PET imaging to monitor their real-time in vivo behavior. We demonstrated that the positive liposomes have the best liver and spleen blockade efficiency among three differently charged liposomes, likely due to their effective electrostatic interaction with negative cell membrane residues (e.g. phosphatidylserine). The influence of liposome dosage and time interval between two injections do not seem to be highly significant within our test range. Based on our observation, an injected dose of 100 mol/kg positive liposomes (much less than previous reports 23, 29) is sufficient for RES blocking, with the liver and spleen uptake of Au NRs decreased by 25% and 52%, respectively. Although more parameters need to be tested before we can ascertain which procedure is most beneficial, our study underlines the fact that various dynamic microenvironments inside the body could greatly influence the RES clearance trends and biodistribution patterns of Au NRs; thus competing with the singular blockade effect of liposomes on macrophages (as shown at cellular level) and resulting in a less predictable estimate of in vivo activity.Meanwhile, we found that the tumor uptake of Au NRs has a relationship with the administered liposome dosage and the time interval between injections. The tumor uptake of Au NMs following injection of 400 mol/kg liposomes 5 h ahead (16.1 1.3 %ID/g at 27 h post-injection) is 20% higher than the tumor uptake following injection of 100 mol/kg liposomes 1 h ahead (13.4 0.5 %ID/g at 27 h post-injection). Our results indicate that the extent of tumor uptake enhancement is not necessarily consistent with the extent to which liver and spleen uptake decreases. Although the tumor heterogeneity might influence the results, our observation begs the question whether suppressing RES macrophage activity and consequently enhancing the blood circulation of NMs is the only way this strategy improves the tumor uptake. The biological identity of NMs or the tumor microenvironment might also be affected by lipids released by destabilized liposomes.As the field of nanomedicine is rapidly expanding with a focus on personalized medicine, refinement of drug delivery technology to work in concert with endogenous biological systems is becoming increasingly relevant. Considering the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the human body, detailed studies are required to identify the in vivo effectiveness of strategies influencing NM delivery. PET imaging proves to be a very important quantitative tool to monitor the biological fate of NMs and to understand the biological mechanisms that will guide the selection of procedures suitable for personalized medicine in the future.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary figures and tables.Click here for additional data file.This work was supported in part, by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0203600), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51502251, 81571743), Fundamental Research Funds for Xiamen University (20720160067), Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2014Y2004), and the Intramural Research Program (IRP), National Institute of Biomedical Imaging (NIBIB), National Institutes of Health (NIH).Notes: The authors declare no competing financial interest.1MinYCasterJMEblanMJWangAZClinical Translation of NanomedicineChem.

The focus of this work was the evaluation of radiolabeled PEGylated liposomes derivatized with varying amounts of a cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptide. RGD peptides are known to bind to v3 integrin receptors overexpressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis.MethodsSeveral liposomal nanoparticles carrying the RGD peptide targeting sequence (RLPs) were synthesized using a combination of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-derivatized lipids for radiolabeling, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) building block, and a lipid-based RGD building block. Relative amounts of RGD and PEG building blocks were varied. In vitro binding affinities were determined using isolated v3 integrin receptors incubated with different concentrations of RLPs in competition with iodine-125-labeled cyclo-(-RGDyV-). Binding of the indium-111-labeled RLPs was also evaluated. Biodistribution and micro single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging studies were performed in nude mice using different tumor xenograft models.ResultsRLPs were labeled with indium-111 with high radiochemical yields. In vitro binding studies of RLPs with different RGD/PEG loading revealed good binding to isolated receptors, which was dependent on the extent of RGD and PEG loading. Binding increased with higher RGD loading, whereas reduced binding was found with higher PEG loading. Biodistribution showed increased circulating time for PEGylated RLPs, but no dependence on RGD loading. Both biodistribution and micro single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging studies revealed low, nonspecific tumor uptake values.ConclusionIn this study, RLPs for targeting angiogenesis were described. Even though good binding to v3 integrin receptors was found in vitro, the balance between PEGylation and RGD loading clearly requires optimization to achieve targeting in vivo. These data form the basis for future development and provide a platform for the investigation of multimodal approaches.liposomesRGD peptidesv3 integrin receptorsangiogenesistumor targetingIntroductionSince their first characterization in 1965 by Bangham et al,1 liposomes have been under extensive investigation. They consist of one or more concentric lipid bilayers with varying size and are unique in their ability to encapsulate and store drugs that differ widely in terms of their physicochemical properties, eg, polarity, charge, and size.2 These drugs include chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, antigens, fungicides, contrast agents, chelating compounds, and radionuclides, which are incorporated into the liposomes aqueous interior or bound within or onto the surface of the lipid membrane.3 A number of anticancer liposomal drug delivery systems have already been approved for clinical use.4,5Notwithstanding their usefulness as carriers for various drugs, a major disadvantage of the in vivo use of liposomal nanoparticles (LNPs) is their recognition by phagocytic cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. This leads to their rapid removal from the blood circulation into mainly the liver and spleen. Workers in the field have conducted extensive investigations into the effects of particle size, lipid composition, and surface charge of the liposome in order to find a solution to this problem.6 One observation of the many experiments conducted was that polyethylene glycol (PEG), a synthetic hydrophilic polymer introduced in the 1970s, improves the pharmacokinetics of liposomes by imparting a steric barrier to the surface of the liposome, thus minimizing opsonization (a process whereby the liposome is marked for destruction via phagocytosis). This reduces recognition by the Kupffer cells of the liver via the scavenger receptor.7 PEGylation has also been found to increase biological stability, to reduce leakage of the encapsulated drug,8 and to prevent aggregation, thus aiding the formation of small, monodispersed particles.9 Much research in this field has been carried out to evaluate, for example, the influence of PEG loading or PEG chain length,7,10 and a number of PEGylated liposomes have obtained approval for clinical use.11In contrast to the above-mentioned limitations, LNPs benefit from the enhanced permeability and retention effect where the long circulation time of nanoparticles allows accumulation in tissues with compromised vasculature, eg, areas of inflammation or tumors.12 The increased microvascular permeability of a tumor, characterized by the absence of a basal membrane and the presence of gaps between the endothelial cells, allows nanoparticles to extravasate from the general circulation. Moreover, the absence of lymphatic vessels promotes accumulation within the tumor environment, causing so-called passive targeting.13 The drawback with this route of accumulation is the lack of cell-specific interaction, which reduces the internalization of the LNP and its encapsulated drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the liposomal carrier is therefore minimized.14 As a consequence, the main challenge in this field is to combine passive with active targeting using target-specific sequences interacting with receptors on the cell surface. This will result in a higher concentration of drug at the tumor site, which will increase the potency of treatments and reduce possible side effects.In the current study, a cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD; cyclo-[-Arg-Gly-Asp-DTyr-Val-]) peptide was used as a target-specific sequence. RGD peptides are active modulators of cell adhesion and can specifically bind to the well-studied v3 integrin receptors. These receptors are expressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis of osteoclasts and are found in invasive tumors such as late-stage glioblastomas, breast and prostate cancer, malignant melanomas, and ovarian carcinomas.15 The formation of new blood vessels is essential for these tumors to supply them with sufficient oxygen and nutrients. The activated endothelium of such angiogenic blood vessels strongly expresses v3 integrin receptors. Most importantly, these v3 integrin receptors are only weakly expressed on endothelial cells in nondiseased tissue, making it a specific target for antiangiogenic therapy monitoring,16,17 improved prognostic evaluation of cancer aggressiveness,18 and tumor angiogenesis imaging.19,20 Therefore, using RGD peptides as integrin antagonists targeting the tumor microenvironment might curtail tumor progression,21 and could also be applied as a noninvasive tool to visualize angiogenesis in growing tumors.In order to perform noninvasive imaging, LNPs can be labeled with metallic radionuclides to follow their in vivo fate using nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography. For this purpose, a variety of radionuclides are used, eg, indium-111 (111In), gallium-68, technetium-99m, fluorine-18, rhenium-188, or copper-64.2225 In addition to using LNPs for diagnostic imaging, they have also been labeled with radium-223, actinium-225, lutetium-177, or yttrium-90 to investigate their potential for use in radionuclide therapy in cancer patients.22,2630 The advantage in using radioisotope imaging of LNPs is that these techniques are extremely sensitive and an absolute quantification of the compound is possible.31 The radiolabeling of LNPs using a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-derivatized lipid building block which allows radiolabeling of liposomes with high specific activity and high stability in vitro and in vivo, respectively has recently been investigated.22Here, the different 111In-labeled LNPs, which differ in their RGD and PEG loading, were evaluated and the influence of these surface modifications on the pharmacokinetics of the liposome was investigated. Additionally, the radiolabeling properties and the in vitro and in vivo fate of different liposomes derivatized with an RGD peptide (RLPs) for targeting and noninvasive imaging of angiogenesis in two tumor xenograft models in nude mice were investigated. Furthermore, these RLPs were used for micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies to explore their future usage in cancer diagnosis and therapy as well as for multimodal imaging.Material and methodsUnless stated otherwise, all reagents were of analytical grade obtained from VWR International (Radnor, PA) or Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO) and used as supplied with no further purifications.1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-DPTA were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc (Alabaster, AL), together with the Avanti Mini-Extruder for liposome preparation. Cholesterol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 111In chloride was obtained either from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA) or Mallinckrodt Medical BV (Petten, The Netherlands) and iodine-125 (125I) from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). The human v3 integrin receptor was purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA).Cell culture media (Gibco Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium [DMEM], Gibco Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 [RPMI 1640]; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), Gibco fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine solution (100X, liquid), sodium pyruvate solution (100 mM, liquid), minimum essential medium nonessential amino acid solution (100X, liquid), and trypsin solution (2.5%, 10X, liquid) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).Human melanoma cells (M21 and M21-L) were a kind gift from Dr David A Cheresh and the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA). Human glioblastoma astrocytoma cells (U-87 MG) were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK).Radioactivity of the samples was measured using a 2480 Wizard2 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer).Preparation of the RGD building blockSynthesis of S-acetyl-3-mercaptopropionic acid (SAMA)-RGDSynthesis of SAMA-RGD was performed using the solid phase peptide synthesis technique with a commercial batch synthesizer using a preloaded 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-Gly-2-Cl-trityl resin and hydroxybenzotriazole/diisopropylcarbodiimide in situ activation. The linear side chain protected peptide was cleaved from the resin using a mixture of 20% 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol in dichloromethane. The crude product (H-Asp[OtBu]-dTyr[tBu]-Lys[1-[4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene]ethyl]-Arg[Pbf]-Gly-OH) was then purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and freeze dried, followed by carbonnitrogen cyclization of the linear protected peptide in acetonitrile by use of benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate. After removal of the 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl protection group of lysine using 2% hydrazine hydrate in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, the crosslinker SAMA was attached onto the side chain amino group of lysine using preactivated SAMA pentafluorophenyl ester. Each cleavage, cyclization, or modification step was finalized by reversed-phase HPLC purification and lyophilization.Crosslinking of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(maleimide[PEG]-2000) (DSPE-PEG[2000]-Mal) and SAMA-RGDThe crosslinking of SAMA-RGD with DSPE-PEG(2000)-Mal was performed by in situ deprotection of the S-acetyl group with hydroxylamine, releasing a free thiol moiety which then reacts with the maleimide group of DSPE-PEG(2000)-Mal. Briefly, SAMA-RGD and DSPE-PEG(2000)-Mal were dissolved in methanol at a molar peptide-to-lipid ratio of 1.5:1 (5.4 106 mol SAMA-RGD:3.6 106 mol DSPE-PEG[2000]-Mal). After the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of hydroxylamine over SAMA-RGD dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.0), the mixture was left to react for 4 hours at room temperature and was finally freeze dried. Completeness of product formation was monitored by reversed-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. Residual amounts of unreacted SAMA-RGD were removed by dissolving the RGD building block in chloroform and the product was again monitored by reversed-phase HPLC, confirming a purity of more than 95%.Preparation of RLPsRLPs were prepared by a thin layer rehydration technique using a ternary lipid mixture, which self-assembles to form sterically stabilized liposomes. Therefore, stock solutions of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG(2000), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-DTPA, and the RGD building block were prepared and dissolved in pure chloroform in a round bottom glass vial. For the different liposome types, aliquots of the above-mentioned components (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG(2000)/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-DTPA/RGD) were mixed in a molar ratio of 3/2/0.3/0.3/0.003 for low RGD loading (lowRLP; 0.06 mol% RGD content), 3/2/0.3/0.3/0.03 for medium RGD loading (medRLP; 0.6 mol% RGD content), and 3/2/0.3/0.3/0.3 for high RGD loading (highRLP; 6 mol% RGD), obtaining a total lipid content of 30 mg/mL. In additional experiments, the relative amount of DSPE-PEG(2000) was varied in medRLP as follows: 0, 0.6, 3, and 6 mol% PEG lipid. A standard liposome carrying no RGD building block (standardLP) was also prepared. The organic solvent (chloroform) was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen yielding a thin lipid film on the side of the glass vial, which was allowed to dry under vacuum overnight. Hydration of the lipid film was achieved by adding 1 mL of 6.6 mM disodium phosphate dihydrate/1.4 mM monopotassium phosphate/136.9 mM sodium chloride phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and repeatedly vortexed for 1 hour at 40C. The lipid suspensions were then extruded 21 times through a polycarbonate filter (EMD Millipore) with a pore size of 100 nm using the Avanti Mini-Extruder. The resulting liposomes were stored at 4C. The maximum storage time for liposomal suspensions was 1 month based on stability studies performed by the authors group.22Characterization of RLPsThe particle size distribution of RLPs was identified using photon correlation spectroscopy. The procedure was carried out with a Submicron Particle Sizer Nicomp 380 (Particle Sizing Systems, Port Richey, FL). This dynamic light scattering instrument is equipped with a 15 mW laser diode and a photomultiplier tube detector with an optical fiber set at 90 degrees to detect the scattered light from the probe. Particle size is derived by an autocorrelation function. Results were expressed as the Z-average, which is the harmonic intensity averaged particle diameter. The width of the size distribution is given by the polydispersity index. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Zeta potential measurements of the various liposomes were performed using a Nicomp 380 ZLS Particle Sizer (Particle Sizing Systems), at 23C and an E-field strength of 5 mV. For the data acquisition, PSS ZPW388 version 1.65 software (Particle Sizing Systems) was used.RadiolabelingBased on the results of Helbok et al,22 the optimized standard labeling protocol was as follows: 111In chloride (5100 MBq/mL) diluted in 0.05 M hydrogen chloride to a volume of 50 L and 50 L of sodium acetate (0.4 M)/gentisic acid (0.24 M) buffer (pH 4.5) were added to 100 L liposomal suspension, resulting in a total reaction volume of 200 L. The labeling solution was allowed to react at room temperature for 30 minutes.For the determination of radiolabeling efficiency (radiochemical yield), instant thin layer chromatography on silica gel strips (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used. Samples were developed with two different mobile phases: (1) 1 M ammonium acetate/0.05 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, in which system labeled RLP and radiocolloid remain at the origin (retention factor radiolabeled RLP and radiocolloid = 0.00.3) and free radionuclide migrates with the solvent front (retention factor free radionuclide = 0.81.0); and (2) acetic acid/pyridine/water (5/3/1.5), in which system labeled RLP and free radionuclide migrate with the solvent front (retention factor radiolabeled RLP and free radionuclide = 0.81.0) and radiocolloids remain at the origin (retention factor radiocolloid = 0.00.2). The distribution of radioactivity was analyzed by electronic autoradiography using the Cyclone Plus Phosphor Imager (PerkinElmer).Evaluation of RLPs in vitroReceptor binding studiesIsolated human v3 integrin receptors were used to determine the in vitro binding affinities of various RLPs. The original method of Nachman and Leung was followed with some modifications.32 For this purpose two different approaches were used: (1) competition assay and (2) binding assay.Competition assayBinding affinities of RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, standardLP) were determined using 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-) as the radioligand, radio iodinated using the iodogen method of Fraker and Speck.33 The day before the experiment, 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with the isolated v3 integrin receptors (10 ng receptor/well) diluted in coating buffer (25 mM tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 0.5 mM magnesium chloride, 10 M manganese[II] chloride tetrahydrate). The receptors were left to incubate for 16 hours at 4C, followed by 2 hours of incubation with blocking buffer (coating buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin) to reduce nonspecific binding of RLP to the wells. Then to each well (in triplicate) 50 L of competitor (RLP) in increasing concentrations (0.0110,000 nM RGD in binding buffer [coating buffer plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin]) and 50 L radioligand solution (~20,000 cpm 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-) in binding buffer; 1 nM) was added. As a control assay, the same procedure was carried out using cyclo-(-RGDyV-) as the competitor. The assay was stopped after 2 hours by removing the solutions. Each well was washed twice with 150 L ice-cold binding buffer. The remaining receptor bound activity was removed with 100 L hot (~60C) 2 M sodium hydroxide solution and transferred into plastic vials which were then measured in a gamma counter. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values were calculated by fitting the data with nonlinear regression (Origin Software; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA).Binding assaySimilar to the above-mentioned assay 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates were coated with the isolated v3 integrin receptors (10 ng receptor/well) for 16 hours at 4C, followed by 2 hours of incubation with blocking buffer. RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, medRLP with 0, 0.6, 3, and 6 mol% PEG lipid) were labeled with 111In chloride and the labeled compounds were incubated with the receptors for 2 hours at room temperature. Additionally, each radiolabeled compound was incubated with 10 M cyclo-(-RGDyV-) to determine nonspecific binding to the wells. After 2 hours, unbound radioligand was removed, the plates were washed twice, and the receptor bound activity collected with hot 2 M sodium hydroxide solution. Samples were then measured in a gamma counter.Evaluation of RLPs in vivoCell cultureEvaluation of RLPs in vivo was carried out using v3 integrin receptor expressing M21 cells, whereas M21-L cells, which do not express the receptor, acted as negative control.34 M21 cells were maintained in DMEM and M21-L cells in RPMI 1640, both cell culture media supplemented with 10% volume/volume (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine solution. M21 cells were grown in tissue culture flasks (Cellstar; Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria) and M21-L cells in germ count dishes (Greiner Bio-One). For imaging studies, U-87 MG cells known to express v3 integrins were used and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine solution, 1% v/v sodium pyruvate solution, and 1% v/v nonessential amino acid solution. All cell lines were grown to confluence at 37C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% carbon dioxide and split every 48 hours.Biodistribution studiesAll animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Austrian animal protection laws and with the approval of the Austrian Ministry of Science (BMWF-66.011/0147-II/10b/2008).Biodistribution studies were performed on 6-week-old female athymic BALB/c nude mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany), which were maintained on a normal ad libitum diet under pathogen-free conditions. For the induction of tumor xenografts, M21 cells were injected subcutaneously at a concentration of 5 106 cells/100 L into the right hind limb and as negative control 3.5 106 M21-L cells/100 L into the left hind limb of the mouse. Tumor size and state of health of the animals was checked regularly. After about 3 weeks, tumor size was about 1 cm in diameter and mice were randomly selected and put into groups of three.On the day of the experiment, mice were injected intravenously into a lateral tail vein with 0.3 MBq (15 MBq/kg bodyweight 111In; injected volume: 150 L) of different 111In-RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, medRLP with no PEG), corresponding to approximately 10 ng RGD/mouse. During the incubation time, mice were kept warm to avoid hypothermia. At 1 hour or 4 hours postinjection, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation without anesthesia by trained personnel using appropriate equipment. Organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach, intestine, kidneys), tissue (blood, muscle), and tumors were removed and weighed. Subsequently, the content of the stomach and intestine were removed and the organs then weighed. The accumulated radioactivity in the different specimens was measured in a gamma counter and results were expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g).Micro-SPECT/CT imaging studiesImaging studies were carried out at the Center for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London (London, UK).About 2 weeks before the experiment, female beige severe combined immunodeficiency mice were injected subcutaneously into the left flank with 2.5 106 U-87 MG cells and tumors were left to grow until they reached a size of about 1 cm in diameter. Subsequently, approximately 12 MBq of 111In-lowRLP, 111In-medRLP, and 111In-highRLP (injected volume: 200 L) was administered via a lateral tail vein of the mouse. After 4, 24, 48, and 96 hours, mice were anesthetized (4% isoflurane and 0.51 L/minute oxygen) and images were obtained using a NanoSPECT/CT in vivo preclinical imager four-head camera (Bioscan, Inc, Washington, DC) fitted with 2 mm pinhole collimators in helical scanning mode (20 projections, 30 minutes). The corresponding CT images were acquired with a 45 kVp X-ray source over 10 minutes. Images were then reconstructed in a 256 256 matrix using InVivoScope software (Bioscan) and fused using PMOD (Mediso Medical Imaging Systems, Budapest, Hungary).StatisticsAll data were expressed as the mean standard deviation. Data of the in vitro assays and the biodistribution studies in tumor-xenografted BALB/c nude mice were compared using an unpaired t-test with a significance level of P 0.01. All analyses were performed using Microsoft Office XP Professional Excel version 10.0.6626.0 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).ResultsCharacterization and radiolabeling of RLPsThe particle size distribution was highly homogenous for all tested RLPs. Results were reproducible and the mean diameter of the liposomes was 92.1 3.1 nm for lowRLP (n = 9), 99.2 2.4 nm for medRLP (n = 7), and 110.4 4.3 nm for highRLP (n = 5). The polydispersity index values of the different liposomal suspensions were 0.0060.2. The zeta potential measurements of the various liposome populations revealed values between 1.8 mV and 6.3 mV.All different RLPs could be labeled with 111In chloride and high radiochemical yield values (95%) were reached even using small amounts of RLP. The following radiochemical yield values were obtained: 98.3% 3.0% for lowRLP (n = 9), 99.4% 0.7% for medRLP (n = 12), and 97.6% 1.7% for highRLP (n = 6). Radiochemical yield values were not influenced by lipid composition and particle size, but deteriorated over time to values below 80% using liposome solutions older than 6 months. Therefore, freshly prepared liposomes (1 month storage) were used throughout the experiments.Evaluation of RLPs in vitroReceptor binding studiesCompetition assayThe in vitro binding characteristics of RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, standardLP) as well as cyclo-(-RGDyV-) as a reference substance were tested in competition with 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-) on isolated v3 integrin receptors. The amount of cell-bound radioactivity (percentage of total activity) was plotted against the amount of lipid/mL of liposome solution (the corresponding RGD values were calculated in g lipid/mL) as shown in Figure 1. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values found in this experiment were 609.4 g lipid/mL for lowRLP, 37.8 g lipid/mL for medRLP, and 6.0 g lipid/mL for highRLP compared to 2570.0 g lipid/mL for standardLP, showing a clear effect of RGD loading on the inhibition of v3 integrin binding of the standard radioligand 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-).Binding assayThe differences in the v3 integrin receptor binding of 111In-labeled RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, medRLP with 0, 0.6, 3, and 6 mol% PEG) were evaluated in a similar manner to the above-mentioned competition assay. These studies showed that with higher RGD loading, binding to the v3 integrin receptors increased from 1.6% of total activity for 111In-lowRLP to 2.2% for 111In-medRLP and 3.8% for 111In-highRLP (Figure 2). In addition, a detrimental effect of PEGylation on binding was shown. 111In-medRLP without PEGylation displayed the highest binding of the tested RLPs with a value of 13.3%, whereas the same 111In-medRLP with 6 mol% PEG demonstrated almost four-fold lower binding (3.4% of total activity) (Figure 3).Evaluation of RLPs in vivoBiodistribution studiesEx vivo distribution properties and receptor specific uptake of different 111In-labeled RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, medRLP without PEGylation) were studied at 1 hour and 4 hours postinjection in BALB/c nude mice bearing either the v3-positive M21 or the M21-L negative control tumor. The results are summarized in Table 1.For all RLPs, comparable results were found. The major uptake was in the spleen and liver, with the highest liver uptake values of 45.7% 2.2% ID/g for 111In-medRLP and 32.9% 5.7% ID/g for 111In-lowRLP, whereas for 111In-highRLP only 21.5% 6.6% ID/g was seen at 1 hour postinjection. PEGylated RLPs displayed high blood levels (111In-lowRLP: 18.1% 2.9% ID/g; 111In-medRLP: 17.0% 5.1% ID/g; 111In-highRLP: 10.0% 4.7% ID/g). Uptake values for the other tissues (heart, stomach, pancreas, intestine, kidneys) at 1 hour postinjection were rather low (9.0% ID/g), with the exception of lungs where the accumulation was 13.1% 1.9% ID/g for 111In-lowRLP, 14.9% 4.1% ID/g for 111In-medRLP, and somewhat lower for highRLP (7.1% 3.2% ID/g) (Figure 4).In contrast to these findings, for 111In-medRLP with no added PEGylation blood levels at 1 hour postinjection were low with 5.0% 0.9% ID/g, whereas the spleen and liver uptake were the highest of all tested RLPs with 25.4% 8.3% ID/g for the spleen and 63.6% 9.6% ID/g for the liver, respectively (Figure 4).At 4 hours postinjection, blood levels had decreased and the uptake in the liver and spleen had increased to 50.6% 11.1% ID/g for 111In-lowRLP, 56.1% 2.2% ID/g for 111In-medRLP, and 30.5% 8.0% ID/g for 111In-highRLP.As shown in Figure 5, uptake in the receptor-positive tumor was 1.0% ID/g for all RLPs, and no significant differences in uptake values between the M21 and the negative control M21-L tumor were found.Micro-SPECT/CT imaging studiesIn contrast to biodistribution studies, small animal imaging studies require administration of higher activities in order to obtain useful images. Therefore, approximately 12 MBq of 111In-labeled RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, and highRLP) were injected to each mouse.In general, in vivo micro-SPECT/CT imaging of RLPs in beige severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing U-87 MG tumor xenografts (left flank) showed similar biodistribution to the ex vivo biodistribution studies with M21/M21-L tumor xenografts, with accumulation of activity in the liver, spleen, and intestine (4 hours postinjection). The images demonstrated similar distribution patterns for 111In-lowRLP (Figure 6A) and 111In-medRLP (Figure 6B). 111In-highRLP (Figure 6C) showed a higher uptake in the spleen compared to the other two RLPs. The nonspecific uptake in the other organs (heart, stomach, pancreas, kidneys) was very low for all RLPs. The receptor-positive tumor was not clearly visualized at 4 hours postinjection and uptake did not increase over time.DiscussionThe use of LNPs to actively deliver agents to disease-associated cells (tumor sites) based upon molecular interaction with cellsurface receptors is an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Good results have already been achieved, especially in combination with targeting moieties such as RGD peptides and those derivatized with PEG to improve pharmacokinetics.3537The current study investigated LNPs carrying RGD and PEG building blocks and their ability to target v3 integrin receptors overexpressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis. Several 111In-labeled RLPs derivatized with varying amounts of RGD and PEG building blocks were prepared to investigate their performance in vitro and in vivo using biodistribution experiments and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies.Until now, research on both in vivo and in vitro properties of targeted liposomes has been limited and concentrated on different targeting moieties.38,39 Previous studies have described the influence of PEG loading on targeting properties in vivo;7 therefore, it was decided to investigate this behavior in vitro with RLPs carrying varying amounts of PEG. In vitro binding to isolated v3 integrin receptors revealed the highest binding when no PEG building block was used (Figure 3) and binding decreased with higher PEG loading of the RLPs. Given the fact that Torchilin et al showed that higher PEG loading (10 mol%) of immunoliposomes caused steric hindrance and resulted in lower accumulation in the target tissue in vivo, the same phenomena might well occur in vitro.40On the other hand, PEGylation is advantageous when using LNPs in vivo as it prolongs their circulation time and reduces recognition by the mononuclear phagocyte system, giving the liposome sufficient time to arrive at its target.41 This hypothesis was confirmed in the M21/M21-L tumor xenograft model. When injected into nude mice, blood levels of 111In-medRLP with no PEG building block were much lower than those of 111In-medRLP with PEGylation. High blood levels are an indication of in vivo stability and are desired since these RLPs are designed to be used as carriers for different drugs that need prolonged circulation times. But in this case, it has to be considered that the RLPs carry the RGD-targeting sequence attached to the end of the PEG chain. If so, it is clear that the amount of PEG connected to the RGD building block was not sufficient for the pronounced stealth effect of the liposome.Concerning the effect of peptide loading of liposomes, initial studies with a tyrosine-3-octreotide peptide attached to LNPs have already been performed by the authors group with promising results.22 Based on these findings, the different RLPs were evaluated with respect to their RGD loading. In the competition assay, the half-maximal inhibitory values of the RLPs showed a clear relationship between RGD loading and replacement of 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-) at the receptor. Almost no competition was observed for lowRLP, whereas the higher loading of medRLP and highRLP decreased the concentration of RLP required to replace 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-) by a factor of about six. As expected, no binding to the isolated receptors and therefore no replacement was observed in the nonderivatized standardLP.When the total binding of 111In-labeled RLPs was determined, higher RGD loading led to significantly higher binding to the v3 integrin receptors (Figure 2). This is in agreement with the results of Du et al who found an RGD dose-dependent uptake in hepatic stellate cells and an increased inhibition of hepatic stellate cell proliferation with cyclic RGD sterically stabilized liposomes.42 The specific uptake in hepatic stellate cells increased with higher RGD loading of the sterically stabilized liposomes, which could be beneficial in treating liver fibrosis. These findings are in accordance with Shokeen et al who used multivalent, functional polymer nanoparticles (CNP) derivatized with varying amounts of a linear RGD peptide (5%, 10%, 20%, 50% RGD loading).43 The results of binding assays on isolated integrins demonstrated an approximate 75-fold increase in binding between 5% RGDCNP and 50% RGDCNP. In contrast to that, Jiang et al observed optimal cellular transfection and tumor inhibition in a drug-resistant MCF7/A tumor with 1% RGD-modified liposomes containing small interfering ribonucleic acid, suggesting that the 1% molar ratio of RGD modification might be the best ratio for targeting integrin receptors.44Nevertheless, biodistribution studies of 111In-labeled RLPs did not confirm the in vitro data. In general, the highest uptake of RLPs was in the liver and spleen, which was expected since LNPs accumulate in these organs due to extraction via the mononuclear phagocyte system. The tumor targeting characteristics were suboptimal, with an uptake in the v3 integrin receptor-positive M21 tumor of less than 1% ID/g (Figure 5). Although tumor uptake values of the M21 tumors were slightly higher than those of the negative control M21-L tumors (with lowest values for lowRLP), the differences were not significant. This outcome was not as anticipated since the in vitro behavior of RLPs seemed to be promising and the authors group has already demonstrated a specific tumor binding of 2.5% ID/g with tyrosine-3-octreotide liposomes,22 which is comparable to the data of Accardo et al.45 An even better tumor uptake of 5.2% ID/g in mice bearing a somatostatin receptor-2-positive human neuroendocrine tumor was found for copper-64-labeled octreotate-encapsulated liposomes.25 Reasons for the reduced tumor targeting of RLPs might be related to the PEG(2000) chain length as reported by Herringson and Altin.11 They suggested that the long PEG(2000) chains disrupt the interaction of liposome-anchored moieties with their receptors and that shorter PEG chains may be advantageous as they would interfere less with binding sites on the tumor. Another reason could be that the v3 integrin receptors of the solid tumors used in the current xenograft model are not as easily accessible as v3 integrins of other tumors or, for example, special antigens located on the vascular endothelial cell surface.46 Lehtinen et al additionally stated that PEGylated liposomes are efficiently taken up at the tumor site by the enhanced permeability and retention effect but it might be possible that active targeting is not visible in a conventional biodistribution study.47 In accordance with these results, specific targeting of RLPs to the tumors could not be visualized using micro-SPECT/CT imaging, but a similar accumulation pattern was seen compared to the ex vivo biodistribution studies.Overall, the experimental results did not show any evidence of specific tumor targeting of RLPs in vivo. As mentioned above, there could be various reasons for this and these results emphasize how challenging liposomal targeting approaches are. For optimal uptake, the ideal concentration of targeting sequences, PEG loading, and also particle formation must be determined. In particular, if the concentration of the targeting moiety is too high, this could lead to an abnormal mononuclear phagocyte system response followed by fast blood clearance of the LNP.43 Montet et al postulated that there is an upper limit for RGD loading and that this limit is reached if the number of RGD peptides on the LNP exceeds that of the receptor binding sites on the cell membrane.48An additional challenge is to choose the optimal injected lipid dose when in vivo targeting is attempted. On the one hand the amount of LNP should be low enough to avoid receptor saturation, on the other hand it has been shown by Laverman et al that circulation times may be reduced and liver uptake increased at very low lipid doses.49 In the current study, a lipid dose of about 0.5 mol/kg bodyweight was injected, a dose where this effect has not been reported. Although the total amount of injected RGD varied, depending on the LNP composition, this cannot explain the overall low tumor uptake in vivo.It may also be argued that 111In is not bound with sufficient stability to the LNP or the LNP itself might not be stable after intravenous injection, resulting in loss of targeting. However, extensive studies have been carried out on the radiolabeling properties and stability of LNPs (also labeled with different radiometals via this approach), which have shown high in vitro stability of the LNPs in competition with aqueous solution, human serum, and DTPA, as well as high blood pool retention in vivo.22 Therefore, the stability seems to be sufficient to achieve targeting in vivo.Another parameter influencing targeting properties and in vivo stability is the size and charge of the LNP. The NPs used in this study only showed a slight variation in size between 90110 nm and no significant differences in zeta potential. But zeta potentials slightly shifted towards a higher positive charge with increased RGD loading, as would be expected. Nevertheless, these differences both regarding size and charge were not pronounced and it seems unlikely that they could account for the observed limited in vivo targeting. It has been suggested that higher negative zeta potential values may have a positive effect on stability,50 and both slightly negative and positive surface charges improve blood circulation kinetics.51 Extensive evaluation of the influence of charge for targeting applications should be a topic of future investigations.Overall studies of the use of liposomes carrying RGD peptides as the targeting moiety are encouraging as these liposomes loaded with paclitaxel (a widely used antimicrotubule agent for the treatment of a variety of cancers) have been shown to have antitumor activity.52 They have also been used for selective cell targeting to treat cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, or inflammation processes.53Future experiments will have to investigate the ideal balance of RGD and PEG loading. Since both the in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PEG has a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics of the liposome and that its presence increases the circulation time in blood, varying PEG lengths or even finding alternatives to PEG, as proposed by Knop et al,54 should be considered. Taking into account that PEG influences binding to tumor sites, further studies could include relocating the RGD derivatization to the PEG building block and varying the amount of RGD loading of the liposome.ConclusionThis study investigated the influence of PEGylation and RGD loading of different LNPs in relation to their targeting properties, in particular to visualize tumor-induced angiogenesis. Even though the influence of PEG loading was shown and good binding to isolated v3 integrin receptors in vitro was found (which could be improved with higher RGD loading), these results could not be confirmed in vivo with biodistribution and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies. Consequently, an optimized balance between PEGylation and RGD loading needs to be found to achieve ideal specific tumor targeting in vivo. Nonetheless, the results of this work still show that LNPs are an attractive tool for targeting strategies. Since new developments in nanotechnology and also molecular biology are increasing, an ideal multimodal nanoparticle featured with different types of ligands used for diagnosis, imaging, and therapy is much needed in the future.AcknowledgmentsDr David A Cheresh and the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA) are acknowledged for providing the human melanoma M21 and M21-L cells.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are the prosperous group of NPs with the capability to apply as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Radiolabeling of targeted SPIONs with positron emitters can develop dual positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI agents to achieve better diagnosis of clinical conditions.MethodsIn this work, N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) conjugated to S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (DOTA) as a radioisotope chelator and bombesin (BN) as a targeting peptide (DOTABNTMCMNPs) were prepared and validated using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) tests. Final NPs were radiolabeled with gallium-68 (68Ga) and evaluated in vitro and in vivo as a potential PET/MRI probe for breast cancer (BC) detection.ResultsThe DOTABNTMCMNPs with a particle size between 20 and 30 nm were efficiently labeled with 68Ga (radiochemical purity higher than 98% using thin layer chromatography (TLC)). The radiolabeled NPs showed insignificant toxicity (74% cell viability) and high affinity (IC50=8.79 g/mL) for the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-avid BC T-47D cells using competitive binding assay against 99mTchydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)BN (714). PET and MRI showed visible uptake of NPs by T-47D tumors in xenograft mouse models.Conclusion68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs could be a potential diagnostic probe to detect BC using PET/MRI technique.Keywordssuperparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticlestrimethyl chitosanbombesingallium-68PET/MRIIntroductionNanoparticles (NPs) are considered as adjustable tools in biology and medicine as targeted drug delivery systems, biosensors, therapeutic and bioimaging agents because of their relatively large modifiable surface area, multimodal imaging properties, and multivalent interactions that increase affinity and residence time to their target.1,2 NPs are being studied as targeted imaging agents due to their unique characteristics such as intrinsic magnetic and optical properties of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and quantum dots, the potential for conjugation of targeting agents, and the capability to load the diagnostic moieties.3,4SPIONs are biocompatible NPs that have attracted enormous attention as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents in clinical trials.5,6 Multifunctional iron oxide NPs as multimodal imaging agents (positron emission tomography [PET]/MRI, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]/MRI, optical/MRI contrast agents) can be utilized to overcome the limitations of single imaging modalities. The magnetic properties of SPIONs have also developed interesting therapeutic features including magnetic targeted drug delivery and hyperthermia. Such theranostic nanocarriers can improve diagnosis, treatment approaches by targeted therapy, and monitor therapeutic localization noninvasively.7,8 In biomedical applications, the surface of SPIONs is usually modified by coating with different materials (eg, polyethylene glycol, dextran, and oleic acid) in order to enhance their biocompatibility and stability in aqueous solutions and supply functional groups for conjugation of anticancer drugs or targeting agents.9,10 Chitosan is a versatile linear biopolymer studied in a variety of biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, drug/gene delivery, and molecular imaging due to its characteristics including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low immunogenicity.11,12 Chitosan solubility only in acidic media is the main limitation in applying chitosan for biomedical applications. N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) is a water-soluble derivative of chitosan with a variety of biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and drug or gene delivery.13,14 TMC as a cationic polymer can be applied as a coating layer for SPIONs to increase the stability of NPs in aqueous media and conjugate targeting ligands, drugs, and imaging agents for targeted therapy or diagnostic applications.Breast cancer (BC) is a lethal commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide, and early detection of BC is the most important strategy to treat the disease easily. Molecular imaging modalities including whole-body 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) and positron emission mammography (PEM) have been evaluated for primary BC diagnosis, staging, and monitoring the response to therapy.15For years, the combination of PET and CT has offered concurrent anatomic and functional information in oncological imaging. In recent years, the integration of PET and MRI into a hybrid system has merged high sensitivity and metabolic characterization of PET with superior soft tissue characterization of MRI. Thus, it is necessary to develop the new radiolabeled contrast agents for PET/MRI.16Radiolabeling of SPIONs with positron emitters can develop PET/magnetic resonance (MR) dual imaging probes.17 Gallium-68 (68Ga; t1/2 67.7 minutes, 89% +) is an attractive positron emitter radionuclide produced by 68Ge/68Ga generator as a continuous source of 68Ga in hospitals. Several 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals such as 68Ga-labeled peptides and antibody fragments for targeted imaging of tumors have been developed and 68GaDOTATATE is the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved radiopharmaceutical to locate somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors, and the number is increasing in EU.There are several specific biomarkers for targeted imaging of BC. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors are overexpressed in a variety of tumors including BC, small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer.18,19 Based on in vitro experiments, GRP receptors were found in many kinds of BC specimens, suggesting valuable opportunity for targeted imaging and/or therapy of BC.20The amphibian analog of the GRP is bombesin (BN) with a high affinity to GRP receptors.21 Radiolabeled BN derivatives have been applied to detect BC in early stages using SPECT and PET techniques.22 BN analogs are a group of peptides used for active targeting of NPs to specifically bind to GRP receptors on the surface of cancer cells.23The aim of the present study was to prepare the TMC-coated SPIONs conjugated to BN derivative and S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DOTA) followed by radiolabeling with 68Ga for ultimate in vitro and in vivo evaluation in BC as a promising agent (Figure 1).Materials and methodsChitosan (110150 kDa, 95% degree of deacetylation) was provided by Primex (Karmy, Norway). All chemicals, reagents, and solvents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Succinyl(Gly)8BN (714) with the sequence of succinyl(Glycine)8-Glutamine-Tryptophan-Alanine-Valine-Glycine-Histidine-Leucine-Methionine-NH2 ((Gly)8GlnTrpAlaValGlyHisLeuMetNH2) (95% purity by HPLC) was obtained from TAG Copenhagen (Frederiksberg, Denmark). S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DOTA) was purchased from Macrocyclics (Plano, TX, USA). Ready-to-use hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)BN kit for the preparation of pentetate (Sn) 99mTcBN (Pars-TCK-2600) and 68Ge/68Ga generator (20 mCi/elution activity, radionuclide purity 99%, radiochemical purity [RCP] 98%, 68Ge breakthrough 0.00007% of total radioactivity) was a gift from Pars Isotope Co. (Tehran, Iran). T-47D cell line was obtained from the Iranian Biological Resource Center (Tehran, Iran). The 68Ge/68Ga generator was eluted by hydrochloric acid solution (0.2 M) and 0.5 mL fractions were collected. The fractions 24 were applied for the radiolabeling procedure.Preparation of NP probesSynthesis of SPIONsMagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized using the coprecipitation method.24 Ammonium hydroxide (25%) was added dropwise to a solution of 0.149 g FeCl24H2O and 0.405 g FeCl36H2O in degassed deionized water under nitrogen atmosphere at 70C until a final pH of 11 was reached and stirred for additional 1 hour at 70C. Fe3O4 NPs were magnetically decanted and washed several times with deionized water and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 40C.Synthesis of TMCThe procedure was carried out according to the reported protocol by Atyabi et al25 with minor modification. A total of 0.5 g chitosan (110150 kDa, 95% degree of deacetylation) was dispersed in 20 mL N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at 60C followed by the addition of sodium iodide (1.2 g, 8.0 mmol), sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (2.75 mL, 15% w/v), and methyl iodide (3 mL, 48.2 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 5 hours at 60C. The product (TMC iodide) was precipitated with acetone, centrifuged (18,000 rpm, 5 minutes), and washed twice with acetone. The sediment was dissolved in 20.0 mL of sodium chloride aqueous solution (10% w/v) to exchange the iodide ions with chloride ions. The resultant solution was dialyzed against distilled water using a dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff 12 kDa; Sigma) for 1 day and finally lyophilized.Synthesis of TMC-coated MNPs (TMCMNPs)Iron oxide NPs (5 mg) were dispersed in deionized water (1 mL) using an ultrasonic probe sonicator (amplitude 50%, 18 W) for 30 minutes followed by the addition of TMC dissolved in deionized water (0.125 mL, 50 mg/mL) and shaken for 24 hours at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged (25,000 rpm, 20 minutes), and the product was washed using deionized water (2).Synthesis of succinyl(Gly)8BN (714)TMCMNP conjugates (BNTMCMNPs)The conjugation was performed by carboxyl-to-amine cross-linking using ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling method.26 Aqueous solutions of EDC (1 mg/mL, 0.2 mL), NHS (1 mg/mL, 0.1 mL), and succinyl(Gly)8BN (714) (10 mg/mL, 40 L) were added to a mixture of TMCMNPs (5 mg) and agitated for 24 hours at room temperature. The product (BNTMCMNPs) was purified by centrifuging the reaction mixture (25,000 rpm, 20 min) and washing with deionized water (2).Synthesis of DOTABNTMCMNPsThe synthesis was performed using amine groups of TMC on the surface of NPs according to the reported procedure.27 To a mixture of BNTMCMNPs (5 mg) in carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5), p-SCNBnDOTA (0.9 mg, 1.31 mol) was added. DOTA-conjugated BNTMCMNPs (DOTABNTMCMNPs) were precipitated by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 30 minutes) and washed with water. Figure 2 shows the MNPs, TMCMNPs, BNTMCMNPs, and DOTABNTMCMNPs in the suspension form.Characterization of NPsThe crystalline properties of MNPs and TMCMNPs were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; PW1800; Philips) with 2 range of 2080 and wavelength of CuK radiation (1.5409 ). Hydrodynamic diameter, size distribution, and zeta potential of all synthesized NPs were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument with the detection angle of 90 at the wavelength of 633 nm at 25C (Nano-ZS; Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (CEM 902A; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was applied to observe the morphology of MNPs, TMCMNPs, BNTMCMNPs, and DOTABNTMCMNPs. Chemical structure of all-prepared NPs and TMC polymer were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Spectrum two, PerkinElmer, USA). Magnetic properties of MNPs and TMCMNPs were determined using vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature (Model 155; Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN, USA).The degrees of quaternization (DQ) and dimethylation (DD) of TMC were calculated using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) spectrum (Avanace 500 MHz; Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), obtained in D2O as a solvent,28,29 and primary amine groups of TMC were measured by the ninhydrin method.30 The reaction of chitosan, TMC, and glucosamine as a standard compound with the ninhydrin reagent was carried out at 100C for 16 minutes, and then, the absorption of solutions was read at 570 nm using UVVIS spectroscopy (CE7500; Cecil, Cambridge, UK). A linear calibration curve was drawn using glucosamine absorptions, and the percentage of free amine groups in TMC was calculated via the absorption of TMC and chitosan.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of MNPs and TMCMNPs was used to measure the mass of TMC coated on MNPs surfaces. Because of the presence of sulfur atom in the peptide structure, conjugation of BN to TMCMNPs was confirmed using elemental analysis (Costech Elemental Combustion System CHNSO, ECS 4010).Determination of ferric ion concentrationColorimetric analyses are commonly applied for the evaluation of iron content in chemical and biological samples. Ferric ions (Fe3+) can form brick-red ferric thiocyanate complexes after reacting with thiocyanate ions (SCN), which show a good linearity at a broad range of Fe3+concentrations.Aliquots (10 L) of DOTABNTMCMNPs in deionized water and standard solutions of iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)39H2O) were added into an equal volume of 12% HCl and agitated for 30 minutes. Aliquots of the obtained solutions (50 L) were added into a 96-well plate followed by the addition of 1% ammonium persulfate solution (50 L) into each well. Brick-red ferric thiocyanate complexes formed by the addition of potassium thiocyanate solution (100 L, 0.1 M) were assayed using a micro-plate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm (BioTek ELx800).31 The ferric ion concentration of DOTABNTMCMNPs was calculated from the equation of the calibration curve and the absorbance of the sample.Phantom studyTo measure the relaxation characteristics of the DOTABNTMCMNPs as a T2-weighted MRI contrast media, varying concentrations of DOTABNTMCMNPs ranging from 25 to 200 M for Fe in deionized water containing 1% agarose were filled into 2.0 mL microcentrifuged tubes. The T2-weighted images were acquired using a 3T MRI Scanner (Magnetom Prisma) with a repetition time (TR) of 2,500 milliseconds, echo time (TE) of 14.2142 milliseconds, flip angle of 180, and matrix measuring 384252.Radiolabeling of NPsAn aliquot of DOTABNTMCMNPs (100 L, 5 mg/mL) dispersed in acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 4.9) was added to 700 L (148 MBq) of 68GaCl3 solution eluted by 0.2 M HCl containing 100 mg HEPES in a 10 mL borosilicate vial. The mixture was vortexed for 10 s and heated at 90C for 5 min. RCP was evaluated by instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel (ITLC-SG) using sodium citrate solution (100 mM) as mobile phase and radiochromatograms were plotted by a TLC scanner (MiniGita, Elysia-Raytest, Germany).Stability test in human serumThe stability of 68Ga-radiolabeled DOTABNTMCMNPs in human serum was assessed by ITLC-SG and sodium citrate solution (100 mM) as the mobile phase.32 Radiolabeled NPs were incubated in human serum (1:10 ratio) at 37C for 180 minutes, and RCP was determined every 30 minutes by TLC. All assays were done in triplicate.In vitro assaysCell cultureGRP receptor-expressing human BC cell line T-47D was cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Biosera, Nuaill, France) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37C with 5% CO2.Cytotoxicity assayThe cytotoxicity of DOTABNTMCMNPs was investigated by MTT assay. The T-47D cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5,000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were treated at the NPs concentration range of 0.1200 g/mL in PBS and incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 for 24 and 48 hours. After each interval, the cells medium was replaced with 50 L of MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL in PBS) and incubated for 3 hours at 37C and 5% CO2. Afterward, 150 L of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve formazan crystals, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm using a microplate reader.In vitro competitive cell-binding assayCompetitive cell-binding assay was used to evaluate the IC50 value of DOTABNTMCMNPs in GRP receptor-expressing human BC cell line T-47D.33 The IC50 value was determined against 99mTcHYNICgamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)BN (714) as a standard GRP receptor binding agent.34 In order to measure the IC50 value, the total concentration of receptors expressed on T-47D cells (Bmax) was determined using the saturation binding assay.The HYNICGABABN (714) cold kit was labeled with 99mTcO4 solution (20 mCi, 1,200 Ci/mmol) according to the kit labeling instruction. In all, 400 L of T-47D cells (1105 cells) in PBS were incubated with 100 L of 99mTcHYNICGABABN (714) (5300 nM in PBS) in triplicate for 1 hour at 37C. Nonspecific binding (NSB) of radiolabeled peptide was estimated using the incubation of excess unlabeled peptide (10 M) to block the specific binding sites for 30 minutes at 37C. At the end of the incubation times, cells were centrifuged (1,200 rpm, 5 minutes), the cell pellets were washed with cold PBS, and their radioactivity was measured using an NaI well counter (Triathler Multilabel Tester; Hidex, Turku, Finland).In order to evaluate the IC50 value of DOTABNTMCMNPs, T-47D cells were aliquoted into 2 mL microcentrifuged tubes (1105 cells), and the 99mTcHYNICGABABN (714) (100 L, 240 nM) cells were added, followed by the addition of various concentrations of DOTABNTMCMNPs (0.00160 g/mL, 46.8 pM2.81 M BN) in triplicate. The tubes were shaken at 4C for 1 hour, and after the incubation time, cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes and washed with cold PBS. The radioactivity of cell pellets was measured using a gamma counter. The IC50 value of DOTABNTMCMNPs was obtained by plotting the radioactivity of 99mTc-HYNICGABABN (714) versus the log of the DOTABNTMCMNPs concentrations using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).In vivo assaysAnimal model developmentAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with National Research Councils Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ethical guidelines/regulations, and the investigation was approved by the ethical committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Code no 1394.223). In all, 8-week-old female athymic nude mice (Pasteur Institute of Iran) were subcutaneously implanted with 3106 T-47D cells in 0.1 mL PBS into the right leg or shoulder. A total of 1012 days after cell implantation, MRI or PET and biodistribution study in tumor-bearing nude mice were investigated. Normal biodistribution of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs was studied in 8-week-old female Balb/C mice.Biodistribution studiesSolutions of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs (3.7 MBq) were injected to the normal Balb/C and tumor-bearing nude mice through the tail vein. The percentage of radioactivity in different organs was calculated at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-injection.In vivo imaging studiesFor animal MRI, shoulder xenograft nude mice were used. The tumor-bearing nude mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine, and magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained pre and post-injection of 100 L DOTABNTMCMNPs (1 mg/mL, 5.12 mM Fe) in deionized water. The T2-weighted fast spin-echo imaging was performed using a 3T MRI under the following conditions: TR/TE: 2,300/110 milliseconds, flip angle: 150, echo train length: 15, slice thickness: 2 mm, and matrix: 256216.PET/CT imaging of T-47D tumor-bearing nude mice in the right leg was accomplished using Siemens Biograph True-Point PET/CT scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). The CT scans of the mice in the supine position were performed for anatomical reference and attenuation correction (spatial resolution 1.25 mm, 80 kV, 30 mAs). Static PET acquisitions were performed with three sets of emission images after injection of 3.7 MBq 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs starting at 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Attenuated corrected PET images were reconstructed using the ordered subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm with four iterations and 21 subsets into a 256256 matrix smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 3 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). Transmission data were reconstructed into a matrix of equal size by means of filtered back projection, yielding a co-registered image set. The reconstructed PET images were then fused with CT images.ResultsCharacterization of synthesized NPsThe crystalline structure of Fe3O4 NPs and TMCMNPs assayed by PXRD is shown in Figure 3A. Six significant peaks for MNPs at 2=30.2, 35.6, 43.2, 53.7, 57.1, and 62.9 were observed in both Fe3O4 NP and TMCMNPs patterns.35Magnetic properties of Fe3O4 NPs and TMCMNPs were evaluated using the VSM method (Figure 3B), and the saturation magnetization values for MNPs and TMCMNPs were obtained as 96.5 and 52 emu/g, respectively. The saturation magnetization of TMC-coated MNPs was lost after the coating process, nevertheless both MNPs and TMC-coated MNPs present superparamagnetic behavior because the coercivity (Hc) of both curves was found to be zero.The mass of TMC coated on MNPs surfaces was measured by TGA. TGA curves of pure Fe3O4 NPs and TMCMNPs (Figure 3C) show 1.93% and 1.67% weight loss in the temperature range of about 25C150C, which relates to the loss of residual water in the samples. Weight loss between 150 and 400C in the TGA curve of TMCMNPs (6.72%) demonstrates weight percentage of polymer coated on MNP surfaces.Hydrodynamic diameter, size distribution, and zeta potential of all synthesized NPs measured by DLS have been given in Table 1.Presence and content of BN peptides on TMCMNPs were evaluated by CHNS elemental analysis of TMCMNPs and BNTMCMNPs using the measurement of sulfur atoms in methionine amino acids. Based on the obtained weight percent of sulfur in samples, the peptide content was calculated as 0.07 mg per 1 mg of BNTMCMNPs.Primary amine groups of TMC were measured by the ninhydrin method using glucosamine as a standard compound.30 Compared to chitosan, 33.7% of primary amine groups were present in the TMC structure after the methylation process.1HNMR spectrum was applied to confirm the introduction of methyl groups at the primary amine groups of chitosan and calculate the DQ and DD in the TMC structure. 1HNMR spectrum of TMC chloride and chitosan showed the signals at 2.85 and 3.06 ppm attributed to the N(CH3)2 and N(CH3)3 groups, respectively. The signals at 2.04, 3.784.57, and 5.115.43 ppm were assigned to the methyl protons of the acetamide groups, H2H6, and H1 protons in the chitosan structure, respectively. The signal at 3.33 ppm in chitosan and TMC 1HNMR spectra can be attributed to the H2 of deacetylated monomers in the chitosan structure and OCH3 protons in TMC polymers. The DQ and DD were calculated 51.3% and 12.8%, respectively.28,29,36Figure 4 displays FTIR spectra of Fe3O4 NPs, TMC, TMC-coated MNPs, BNTMCMNPs, and DOTABNTMCMNPs. The strong absorption at 584 cm1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of FeO band of Fe3O4 NPs and exists in other spectra except for the TMC spectrum. The OH stretch is a broad peak at 3,0003,430 cm1 (Figure 4A). The TMC spectrum showed absorption peaks at 1,634 cm1 (C=O stretching of amide II), 1,057 cm1 (CO and CN stretching), and 3,437 cm1 (OH and NH stretching) and characteristic bending absorption at 1,368 cm1 for methyl groups (Figure 4B). FTIR spectra of TMCMNPs in Figure 4C exhibit characteristic bands of TMC and pure MNPs, which demonstrates the polymer coating of MNPs. The BNTMCMNPs spectrum (Figure 4D) shows that the peaks at 1,537, 1,634, and 3,282 cm1 are assigned to the NH bending of amide I and II, C=O band of amide I, and NH stretch in primary amides in the BN sequence, respectively (Gln side chain and c-terminal amide of BN). In the DOTABNTMCMNPs spectrum (Figure 4E), the carbonyl groups of DOTA carboxylic acid moieties appeared at 1,734 cm1, which demonstrates DOTA linking to the NPs.Figure 5AD exhibits the TEM images of MNPs, TMCMNPs, BNTMCMNPs, and DOTABNTMCMNPs in which the 30 nm spherical NPs in all images are distinguished. As seen in Figure 5D, a very thin layer of TMC polymer is visible on the surface of MNPs.Radiolabeling of NPsIn thin layer chromatography studies, free 68Ga (III) cations form 68Ga citrate complexes and migrate to Rf 0.6, while the radiolabeled NPs retain at the base (Rf 0.1). 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs RCP was higher than 98% (46,250 MBq/mmol Fe), which could be used without further purification for later studies.Stability in human serum68Ga-radiolabeled DOTABNTMCMNPs were incubated in human serum at 37C for 180 minutes, and RCP was checked every 30 minutes by radio-TLC as mentioned in the Materials and methods section. 68Ga citrate complexes migrate to Rf 0.50.7 on ITLC-SG using sodium citrate solution as the mobile phase, while the 68Ga-labeled NPs retain at the base (Rf 0.1). As shown in Figure 6, 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs had 92% stability after 120 minutes and 86% stability after 180 minutes.Cytotoxicity assayIn vitro cytotoxicity of DOTABNTMCMNPs on T-47D cells at the concentration range of 0.1200 g/mL showed insignificant toxicity for the cells in comparison with that for the nontreated cells (Figure 7), and 76.7%2.9% and 74.0%3.7% of the cells were survived in contact with the highest concentration (200 g/mL) of NPs after 24 and 48 hours.In vitro competitive cell-binding assayThe total concentration of GRP receptors expressed on T-47D cells (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) for 99mTcHYNICGABABN (714) were determined using saturation binding assay. As depicted in Figure 8A, specific binding of 99mTcHYNICGABABN (714) to GRP receptors on the cell surfaces was plotted versus the concentration of the radiopeptide added. The Bmax and Kd values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 Software (nonlinear regression analysis, binding saturation, one site-specific binding) as 212.1 and 17.86 nM, respectively.The IC50 value of DOTABNTMCMNPs was evaluated using the competitive binding assay against 99mTcHYNICGABABN (714) in BC T-47D cells (Figure 8B). The IC50 value of DOTABNTMCMNPs was 8.79 g/mL (411.1 nM for BN).Biodistribution studiesThe percentage of injected dose per gram of organs (%ID/g) for 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs in normal Balb/C and tumor-bearing mice was determined at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-injection (Figure 9A). Radiolabeled NPs were rapidly cleared from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) cells in the liver and spleen. Compared to the normal model, the percentage of ID/g for all organs significantly did not change in tumor-bearing mice. The percent tumor uptake of radiolabeled NPs was 0.78% at 30 minutes, 1.56% at 60 minutes, 1.75% at 90 minutes, and 2.27% at 120 minutes, which indicated incremental accumulation of targeted NPs in the tumor. As shown in Figure 9B, tumor-to-tissue ratios also confirmed increasing uptake of NPs in the tumor over the time.MRI studiesRelaxation characteristics of DOTABNTMCMNPs were measured using serially diluted aqueous solutions of 200 M DOTABNTMCMNPs for Fe. T2-weighted images of solutions (Figure 10A) showed decreased signal intensity when the Fe concentration rose, and the T2 relaxivity (r2) was calculated as 330.98 mM1s1 for DOTABNTMCMNPs (Figure 10B).MRI of T-47D tumor-bearing mice at shoulder has been shown in Figure 10C before and Figure 10D after administration of DOTABNTMCMNPs. The decrease in MR signals in tumor lesion due to the specific uptake of DOTABNTMCMNPs made this region darker (yellow circle in Figure 10D) and improved the image contrast as a result.PET imaging studiesPET/CT images were acquired at 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-injection of 3.7 MBq 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs in T-47D tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Figure 10E, there is the most activity concentration in liver and tumor. The activity in the spleen and bladder is slightly higher than the background activity 120 min post-injection. Quantitative assessment of PET/CT images was performed by measurement of maximum and peak standardized uptake values, SUVmax and SUVpeak, for tumor inoculated in the right leg, left leg (control), and liver.DiscussionAt present, the development of MRI contrast agents radio-labeled with positron emitters as PET/MR dual-modality imaging probes is an attractive field of research. PET/MRI can merge the high spatial resolution of MRI with an excellent sensitivity and quantitative data analysis of PET.17 Compared to the gadolinium chelates, higher biocompatibility and modifiable SPIONs surfaces offer targeted and radiolabeled SPIONs as T2-weighted PET/MR dual imaging probes for early detection of cancers.37The high mortality rate of BC in women has led to the crucial need for early and accurate diagnosis of malignant lesions. GRP receptors overexpressed on the surface of BC cells can be targeted using BN as a specific ligand attached to the NPs.In this study, we developed SPIONs coated by TMC and conjugated to BN as targeting ligands and DOTA as 68Ga chelators. Obtained NPs were radiolabeled with 68Ga to detect BC in mice models using MRI and PET techniques.Uncoated SPIONs tend to agglomerate into larger particles and lose their superparamagnetic properties in suspension.38 TMC as a water-soluble and cationic derivative of chitosan was selected for coating of SPIONs. Designed NPs containing SPIONs covered with TMC showed a good stability in aqueous media in a broad range of pHs required for DOTABNTMCMNPs synthesis and radiolabeling procedures.Since the primary amine groups of TMC were needed for conjugation of Succinyl(Gly)8BN (714) and p-SCNBnDOTA to TMCMNPs, measurement of primary amine groups in TMC was essential. This estimation was performed by quantitative ninhydrin assay and 1HNMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, ninhydrin assay results were correlated with quantitative measurements of 1HNMR spectrum. TMC was coated on SPIONs by electrostatic interactions between positively charged TMC and anionic MNPs. Furthermore, the chemical affinity of hydroxyl and amine groups in the TMC structure to SPIONs can improve the attachment and stability of coating layer on iron oxide NPs.39Excellent magnetic properties are the mainstay for SPIONs applied as T2-weighted MRI contrast agents. Magnetic properties of bare SPIONs were as great as the coating process could not dramatically diminish their saturation magnetization based on VSM results.The evaluation of hydrodynamic diameter revealed that the size of SPIONs was increased following polymer coating and peptide conjugation. However, conjugating of DOTA to BNTMCMNPs caused no meaningful change in the hydrodynamic size of NPs due to the small molecular size of p-SCNBnDOTA. Cationic nature of TMC polymer increased significantly the surface charge of MNPs from 1.560.23 mV to +32.43.27 mV (P0.05). The theoretically calculated charge of the intact peptide (Succinyl(Gly)8BN [714]) was positive, so peptide conjugation to the surface of TMCMNPs slightly raised the zeta potential of NPs. The presence of negatively charged carboxylate groups in the DOTA structure diminished the zeta potential of prepared DOTABNTMCMNPs to +16.81.86 mV.TEM images of DOTABNTMCMNPs exhibited spherical coreshell shapes with a low thickness of TMC around MNPs. Functionalization of TMCMNPs with BN and DOTA had the negligible effect on size and morphology of final NPs (Figure 5B).Peptide conjugation efficiency to NPs has been estimated using UVVIS spectroscopy and Bradford protein assay.40,41 As TMC interfered with the BN content assay using these methods, CHNS analysis was applied to measure peptide content of BNTMCMNPs. Considering the presence of a sulfur-containing amino acid (methionine) in the peptide sequence and the absence of sulfur atoms in the chemical structure of TMCMNPs, the peptide mass was calculated by measuring the number of sulfur atoms in the structure of BNTMCMNPs in comparison with that of TMCMNPs.Regarding previously reported studies, both pre- and postcoated SPIONs with chitosan have demonstrated good biocompatibility in biological media.42,43 The MTT test of DOTABNTMCMNPs on T-47D cells indicated that NPs had no remarkable cytotoxicity even at the highest concentration (200 g/mL). As more than 80% cell viability was observed at 0.1100 g/mL of NPs after 48 hours, this concentration range was chosen for further in vitro assays.Despite lower stability constant of DOTA (log KGal=21.3) for 68Ga labeling in comparison with NOTA (log KGal=31.0)44,45 and elevated temperature requirement for radiolabeling with 68Ga, DOTA is the preferred macrocyclic chelator to coordinate 68Ga because of the availability of different bifunctional derivatives and sufficient in vivo stability of its complex with Ga(III).42 Furthermore, DOTA can form stable complexes with such therapeutic radionuclides as yttrium-90 and lutetium-177 to complete a theranostic feature in tandem with 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs. The stability results of radiolabeled NPs exhibited 7% release of 68Ga from prepared in human plasma and trivial release in labeling mixture during 2 hours.In vitro competitive binding assay has been performed on T-47D cells using different BN peptide sequences conjugated to the various linkers, chelating agents, and fluorescent dyes against 125ITyr4BN to determine their binding affinity for GRP receptors. The IC50 values of these peptides have been reported between 1.7 and 383 nM.46,47 There are limited studies on the binding affinity of BN conjugated to NPs for GRP receptors in BC cell lines. Nripen et al33 have evaluated the cell-binding affinity of gold nanorodbombesin (GNRBN) conjugates toward prostate cancer (PC3) and BC (T-47D) cell lines using 125ITyr4BN as a GRP receptor-specific peptide. The IC50 values for GNRBN conjugates with incremental BN content were reported as 7.57, 3.52, and 2.12 g/mL in T-47D cells. In this study, the IC50 value for DOTABNTMCMNPs was calculated for T-47D cells using 99mTcHYNICGABABN (714). The HYNICGABABN (714) kit is routinely applied for localization, staging, and follow-up care after cancer treatment in breast and prostate tumors with positive GRP receptors using the SPECT scan. The amino acid sequence of BN in this kit contains the C-terminal region of BN, which is the active site and has a high binding affinity to GRP receptors.48,49 The obtained IC50 value for DOTABNTMCMNPs is 8.79 g/mL (411.1 nM for BN), and it is assumed that DOTABNTMCMNPs have great ability to compete with radiopeptides toward GRP receptors.In vivo validation tests of radiolabeled and cold DOTABNTMCMNPs were carried out using biodistribution assay, PET/CT, and MRI. Based on biodistribution assessment in normal mice, liver and spleen retained high activity. Notably, the majority of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs cleared from blood circulation during the first 30 minutes via Kupffer cells phagocytic sequestration in the liver. A high liver uptake of NPs has occurred after opsonization of them upon contact with blood and recognition of opsonized proteins by macrophages.50 Moreover, the activity of small intestine started to increase following the reduction in liver activity, which represents the elimination pathway of NPs. Since the large particles mostly accumulate in the lung, very low detected radioactivity in lung indicates the appropriate size distribution of radiolabeled NPs in serum.Various factors can influence on the efficient delivery of NPs to malignant tissue in mice models including hydrodynamic diameter, shape, surface charge, and composition of NPs as well as tumor model, cancer type, and targeting strategies. Wilhelm et al51 after literature survey reported that only 0.7% (median) of the injected dose of NPs is found to reach a solid tumor. Tumor uptake of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs was quantified by biodistribution analysis in the tumor mice models. Radiolabeled NPs were localized in the tumor tissue in an upward trend as 2.27% (%ID/g) of the injected dose was detected in target tissue 120 minutes after injection. The three-fold growth of radioactivity in the solid tumor over time might be attributed to the receptor-mediated pathway in addition to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Moreover, increasing of tumor-to-muscle uptake ratio (5.1711.34 times) confirmed the tumor accumulation of radiolabeled NPs. Since the free gallium excretes mostly into the urine52 and the renal system can excrete NPs 5.5 nm in hydrodynamic diameter,51 a low accumulation of NPs in nontarget organs, especially in kidneys and bladder, can be related to high in vivo stability of 68Ga-labeled NPs.The sensitivity of MRI contrast agents is determined by their relaxivity. The higher relaxivity allows for contrast-enhanced MRI at the lower concentration of MR contrast agent. Relaxivity of DOTABNTMCMNPs was measured using MRI and obtained as 330.98 mM1s1. Feridex (ferumoxides) and Resovist (ferucarbotran) are MRI contrast media based on coated SPIONs approved as T2- and T2*-weighted MRI contrast agents for liver. Relaxivity of ferumoxides and ferucarbotran was reported as 93 (8799) and 143 (132154) mM1s1 at 3T,53 which is much less than DOTABNTMCMNPs relaxivity (r2=330.98 mM1s1). So DOTABNTMCMNPs can be utilized as a potential contrast enhancer in MRI.DOTABNTMCMNPs were synthesized as PET/MR contrast media to visualize BC tumors in mice models, so the tumor uptake of NPs was evaluated by the MRI technique. Despite the lower sensitivity of MRI in comparison with PET imaging, iron concentration of DOTABNTMCMNPs was as sufficient as they can be detected by MRI in tumor lesion. The high accumulation of NPs in the liver obtained through MRI was very similar to the data observed from the biodistribution assay.Subsequently, PET/CT imaging showed the apparent uptake of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs in T-47D tumor inoculated into the right leg. Highly efficient 68Ga labeling of DOTABNTMCMNPs and the high sensitivity of PET imaging led to a superior visibility of tumor by a lower concentration of NPs (0.62 mg/mL). There was a high accumulation of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs in the liver as observed in biodistribution assay results and MRI. The SUVmax and SUVpeak ratios of tumor to the left leg (control) were calculated using PET/CT scans at 120 minutes and obtained as 19.6 and 15.4, respectively, indicating the meaningful uptake of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs in tumor lesion. The tumor-to-liver ratio of maximum SUV was 0.178, associated with quick extraction of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs in the hepatic first pass. Moreover, the ratios of tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-liver uptake in the biodistribution assay were 11.34 and 0.197, which were correlated with PET/CT scan SUVs. It indicates that a simpler and less invasive estimation of biodistribution can provide using calculated SUVs of PET/CT scan.ConclusionOur findings demonstrated that BN conjugated to the surface-modified MNPs can be a promising agent for GRP receptor targeting. Small hydrodynamic size, low toxicity, highly efficient radiolabeling with 68Ga, high serum stability, and strong binding affinity (IC50=8.79 g/mL) of DOTABNTMCMNPs toward GRP receptors make these NPs suitable for dual-modality PET/MRI of prostate, breast, and lung cancers.Compliance with ethical standardsAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.AcknowledgmentsThis research was a part of Maliheh Hajiramezanalis PhD thesis54 (Department of Radiopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran) and was supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA; CRP Code: F22064) and the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (grant number 26985), Tehran, Iran.

However, for this purpose, the micelles need to be radiolabeled, and almost all radiolabeling procedures published to date involve the conjugation of a chelating agent to the constituting polymer, which could actually affect their biodistribution. In this paper, we report a new facile method for radiolabeling polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer micelles without the necessity of any chemical modification. Instead, we entrap the radiolabel (i.e., 111In) in the micellar core during the formation of the micelles by using tropolone as lipophilic ligand.MethodsMicelles were prepared by emulsifying a polymer solution in chloroform with a buffer containing 111In and lipophilic ligand tropolone, by stirring for about 2h. The produced micelles were physically characterized by means of dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The biological properties of the radiolabeled micelles were determined by means of in vivo and ex vivo evaluation. SPECT analysis was done on Balb/c-nu mice, after administration of 1mg micelles containing 22MBq of 111In. SPECT images were obtained over 24h. Biodistribution of the micelles was assessed also ex vivo.ResultsThe radiolabeling method is robust and reproducible with constant radiolabeling efficiency (~30%) even at indium concentrations that are much higher than the necessary for in vivo studies, and the radiolabel retention is more than 80% in mouse serum at 48h. Radiolabeled micelles having hydrodynamic radius of 9713nm have been successfully evaluated in vivo and ex vivo in non-tumor-bearing mice, revealing significant blood circulation up to at least 24h post injection, with low accumulation in most organs except for the liver and spleen, which are the natural organs for clearance of nanoparticles.ConclusionsAn easy and robust radiolabeling method has been developed, and its applicability is demonstrated in animal studies, showing its value for future investigation of polymeric micelles as nanocarriers in tumor-bearing mice.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13550-016-0167-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.KeywordsRadiolabelingPolymeric micellesAmphiphilic diblock copolymersSPECThttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963Seventh Framework ProgrammePITN-GA-2012-317019SantiniCostanzaissue-copyright-statement The Author(s) 2016BackgroundPolymeric micelles are promising nanocarriers for pharmaceutical formulations due to their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic substances, overcoming in this way the poor solubility of some drugs and allowing transport through the blood stream to the site of interest [1, 2]. These micelles are constituted by amphiphilic block copolymers, which in aqueous solutions are able to self-assemble into supramolecular structures. In contrast to self-assemblies composed of low molecular weight surfactants, diblock copolymer micellar aggregates usually exhibit a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) which enhances their integrity even at low concentration [3]. By varying the composition, the size, and the structure of the block copolymers, i.e., tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic block ratio, and/or by adjusting the micelle production method, it is possible to design polymeric micelles with well-defined dimensions and morphologies [4, 5]. These favorable characteristics of polymeric micelles have already led to clinical applications for systemic chemotherapy [6, 7]. In these applications, bringing the micelles to the desired site is essential for therapeutic success, which can be accomplished by exploiting either active or passive targeting pathways. Nanocarriers in general can accumulate in diseased tissue due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, also referred to as passive targeting. Growing tissue, especially tumors, can establish new vascular systems to supply themselves with oxygen and nutrients. The newly formed vessels, however, have a discontinuous endothelium and lack of lymphatic drainage, enhancing in this way extravasation and retention of large particles over time [8, 9]. Long blood circulation time can increase the needed in vivo availability and is therefore an important factor to improve accumulation in tumor tissue. In active targeting, antibodies or peptides are used to ensure tumor uptake, but in the case of nanoparticles even when such targeting vectors are present, it is still imperative that these entities remain in blood circulation for sufficiently long time [10].Even though the scientific community is gaining considerable knowledge about the various factors that can affect the biodistribution of nanoparticles, it is still difficult to predict the in vivo behavior of new formulations, making pre-clinical evaluation absolutely essential. Nuclear imaging approaches such as SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography) are very suitable for this purpose, since they offer high detection sensitivity at high temporal and spatial resolution. These techniques do, however, require radiolabeling of the micelles prior to imaging. Several methods for radiolabeling of polymeric micelles are described in the literature, all involving the conjugation of the micelles with a chelate or complexing agent (e.g., DOTA or DTPA) which requires additional synthetic steps [11]. In addition, the attachment of such a chelate could alter the corona of the micelles and hence their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics [1214].In this paper, we present a new, facile radiolabeling method based on passive loading that is applied to micelles composed of the diblock copolymer polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO). The non-ionic hydrophilic corona of the micelles is composed of PEO, often referred to as poly(ethylene glycol), which is commonly used in nano-particle formulations to enhance their stealthy surface chemistry [2, 13]. The hydrophobic counterpart is formed by the PS, which has a high glass-transition temperature (Tg) and is extremely hydrophobic, ensuring stability of the micelles and a low release rate of any hydrophobic load [14]. The radiolabeling method described here bypasses the covalent attachment of a chelating agent since a lipophilic ligand (tropolone) complexed with the radionuclide (in this case 111In) is entrapped in the micellar core leaving the PEO corona unaffected. In this paper, we describe this radiolabeling strategy and demonstrate the ease and efficiency of this procedure as well as an initial in vivo evaluation of these micelles in healthy mice using SPECT.MethodsChemicalsThe block copolymer PS-b-PEO with a Mn (number average molar mass) of 9500-b-18,000g/mol was purchased from Polymer Source (Quebec, Canada). The block copolymer was nearly monodisperse with a Mw/Mn ratio (Mw is the weight average molar mass) of 1.09. The 111InCl3 was obtained as solution in 10mM hydrochloric acid from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (Petten, The Netherlands) with a specific activity of 1.72MBq/pmol. Indium chloride, Sephadex G-25 and Sepharose 4B size exclusion chromatography resins, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (PIPES) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and tropolone from Merck. Ultrapure water was prepared with the in-house Milli-Q system from Merck Millipore.Production and radiolabeling of micellesFormation of 111In-tropolone complexes was executed by adding 50kBq 111InCl3 to 2.3mL of 10mM HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.8mM of tropolone. The sample was incubated for about 5min at room temperature. Subsequently, 100L of a solution of PS-b-PEO block copolymer in chloroform was added to reach a polymer concentration of 4.3mg/mL. The mixture was stirred at room temperature in a fume hood using a glass stirring bar in an open glass vial for about 2h until the chloroform had evaporated. Unencapsulated 111In-tropolone was removed from the radiolabeled micelles by means of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Sephadex G-25 column with a diameter of 1cm and a length of 301cm, using 10mM HCl as eluent. The 111In activity in the eluted fractions was analyzed using a Wallac WIZARD2 2480 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer), by measuring the peak area of the 171- and 245-keV photon peaks. The labeling efficiency was determined as the amount of 111In encapsulated in the micelles relative to the total amount of 111In added to the sample.Physical characterization of the micellesSamples used for the physical characterization of the micelles were prepared exactly the same way as described above but using non-radioactive indium chloride.The sample used in the dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies was prepared in duplicate and contained 4.3mg/mL PS-b-PEO. Prior to the measurements, the sample was diluted 10, 50, and 200 times using HEPES buffer and each diluted sample was measured three times following protocols described previously [15]. The DLS apparatus consisted of a JDS Uniphase 633nm 35mW laser, an ALV sp 125s/w 93 goniometer, a fiber detector, and a PerkinElmer photon counter. An ALV-5000/epp correlator and software completed the set-up. The DLS sample cell was placed in a temperature-regulated bath containing toluene as the index-matching fluid. The intensity autocorrelation function, g(2)(), was determined at 90. The measurements were performed at 221C. The RH of the micelles was determined using the CONTIN method, and the radius was calculated from the diffusion coefficient of the particles using the Einstein-Stokes equation.The samples used in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis contained 1.1mg/mL and 4.3mg/mL PS-b-PEO. Prior to analysis, a five-time dilution was made in HEPES buffer. A drop of the micellar solution was pipetted onto a carbon-coated copper grid of 200mesh (Quantifoil, Jena, Germany). Excess liquid was removed with a tissue, and the grid was left to dry before placing the specimen into the microscope. A JEM 1400 TEM (JEOL) was used with a LaB6 electron source, operated at an acceleration voltage of 120keV.Partition studiesFor the partition study, 4mL of either PIPES or HEPES buffer, containing 0.8M tropolone and 5kBq 111In was mixed with an equal volume of chloroform during 30s using a vortex. The aqueous and organic phases were left to separate gravimetrically, after which 1mL of each phase was transferred into a counting vial and measured using the automatic gamma counter described previously. The distribution ratio (D) of the 111In was calculated according to the following equation:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ D=\\frac{{\\left[{}^{111}\\mathrm{In}\\right]}_{\\mathrm{chloroform}}}{{\\left[{}^{111}\\mathrm{In}\\right]}_{\\mathrm{HEPES}\\ \\mathrm{buffer}}} $$\\end{document}D=111Inchloroform111InHEPESbufferIn which [111In]chloroform is the concentration of 111In in the chloroform phase, and [111In]HEPES buffer is the concentration of 111In in the aqueous phase. The D was assessed at pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.4, and 8.5.Optimization of the radiolabeling parametersIn the optimization studies, the following parameters were sequentially tested: the polymer concentration, the 111In activity (i.e., the amount of indium), the tropolone concentration, and the pH. The polymer concentration varied from 0.22 to 8.7mg/mL. In the optimization of the indium activity studies, non-radioactive indium was used in addition to 111In for safety reasons. The indium concentration ranged from 1.3pM to 130nM, corresponding to 5kBq and 500MBq 111In per sample of 2.3mL, respectively, which is referred to as 111In equivalent. Stock solutions of non-radioactive InCl3 were prepared in 10mM HCl, and for quantification, either 5 or 50kBq of 111In was added to the sample. The tropolone concentration was varied from 0.8nM to 80M, using stock solutions of tropolone in HEPES. PIPES buffers at pH 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 and HEPES buffers at pH 7.4 and 8.5 were used in the pH optimization studies.Radiolabeling of preformed micellesThe micelles were prepared as follows: 100L of a PS-b-PEO block copolymer solution in chloroform was added to 2.3mL of HEPES buffer containing 0.8mM tropolone. The mixture was stirred until the chloroform had evaporated. To this solution, 111In-tropolone chloroform solution was added in portions of 2L, which was itself prepared by extracting the 111In into chloroform from a solution containing 1mM tropolone in HEPES. The addition was done at 30-s intervals, until an activity of 50kBq was reached. The unencapsulated 111In-tropolone was removed from the radiolabeled micelles by means of SEC. The 111In activity was measured as previously described using an automated gamma counter. Labeling efficiency was calculated relative to the total amount of 111In added to the sample.Retention studiesThe retention of the 111In radiolabel in the micelles was assessed in PBS and in mouse serum. For both samples, 3mL of the radiolabeled micelles solution was mixed with an equal volume of either PBS or serum. As control, 1mL of the same sample was analyzed on the day of preparation. The samples were stored in an incubator at 37C, and after 24 and 48h, the retention of the radiolabel was analyzed. The micelles in the serum samples were separated from the released 111In using a Sepharose 4B gel SEC column with a diameter of 1cm and a length of 301cm. The micelles in the PBS were separated from the released 111In by using a Sephadex G-25 SEC column having the same dimensions as in the serum studies, using 10mM HCl as eluent.In vivo and ex vivo evaluationMicelles for in vivo tests were prepared as described in the Production and radiolabeling of micelles section, using a starting concentration of polymer adjusted to the number of animals and the required final polymer amount of 1mg per animal. The sample was centrifuged for 90min at 2300g using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Merck Millipore). The concentrated micellar solution was recovered from the filter and filled up to the required injection volume with PBS.The biodistribution of PS-b-PEO micelles was tested in Balb/c-nu mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). Three mice received an injection of 200L of solution containing 22MBq of 111In in 1mg of micelles. Immediately after the injection, the mice were anesthetized with a gas mixture of isoflurane (Pharmachemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands) (4% induction, 2% maintenance) and oxygen (0.8%) and subjected to SPECT/CT scan (NanoSPECT/CT, Bioscan Inc., California, USA). One mouse, randomly chosen, was subjected to a dynamic scan during the first 60min post injection (pi) using a matrix of 256256pixels, 16 projections, 20s per projection. Static images were further acquired 30min pi, 4h pi, and 24h pi, using a matrix of 256256pixels, 20 projections with 60s per projection. A CT scan (240 projections, 500ms exposure time 55kVp tube voltage) was performed for anatomical reference.For biodistribution analyses after the last SPECT/CT acquisition, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Blood was immediately drawn via heart puncture and stored in a collection vial, then both the cadaver and the vial containing the collected blood were measured in a dose calibrator (Comecer VDC-404, COMECER Netherlands, Joure, The Netherlands) to have a measure of retention of radioactivity in the body. After the total body count, a selection of different organs was harvested. The uptake of the micelles in different tissues was calculated using the Wallac Wizard 1480 automated gamma counter (PerkinElmer) by measuring the emitted radiation. Part of the spleen, part of the liver, and the complete right kidney of one mouse were collected and stored at 80C for ex vivo autoradiography evaluation. From the frozen tissues, 15-m tissue sections were cut, mounted on glasses, and processed for ex vivo autoradiography.The slides were placed in a sensitive phosphor-imaging screen (PerkinElmer), and read out was performed 3days later using the Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Packard). Quantification of the autoradiograms was carried out with Optiquant (Software version 5.0. PerkinElmer).All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Dutch animal welfare regulations and approved by the Central Animal Testing Committee (Dutch: Centrale Commissie Dierproeven).Data analysisThe obtained in vitro data were processed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 package). ANOVA was used for statistical evaluation. All the in vivo data collected were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, version 5).ResultsPhysical characterization of the micellesThe morphology of the micelles has been assessed by DLS and TEM. Figure1 shows the RH of the micelles for different dilutions. According to the DLS analysis, the micelles appear to have good stability upon dilution, having variations in the hydrodynamic radius within the measurement uncertainty. The overall average hydrodynamic radius has been found to be 9713nm (N=18).Fig. 1Size distribution of the PS-b-PEO micelles. Micelles are prepared at a polymer concentration of 4.3mg/mL. The hydrodynamic radius has been determined by DLS for samples that have been diluted at 10, 50, and 200 timesThree representative TEM images of the micelles are given in Fig.2, in which the PS core is clearly visible as dark stains on a grey background. The PEO corona has lower electron density compared to the PS, and hence, it is (nearly) invisible. Most of the micelles appear to have spherical shape with diameter of the PS core ranging from 25 to 40nm, irrespective of the polymer concentration. A small number of rod-like micelles with different lengths have also been observed (Fig.2c). Their presence can explain the larger dimensions of the micelles measured by DLS since the presence of a small number of large objects can contribute significantly to the scattered light signal leading to a shift of the apparent hydrodynamic size to larger values.Fig. 2TEM images of PS-b-PEO micelles. Images of a spherical micelles, b magnified image of a c rod-like micelle between a few spherical ones. The concentration of the samples in a and b is 4.3mg/mL and in c is 1.1mg/mLRadiolabelingPrior to the optimization of the radiolabeling parameters, the distribution ratio, D, of 111In in a mixture of chloroform and HEPES buffer containing tropolone had been determined. The obtained distribution ratio is 4.80.5 indicating that in the presence of tropolone, indium has a clear preference for the organic phase, due, most likely, to the formation of an In-tropolone complex having lipophilic character. The results for D at pHs other than 7.4, given in Additional file 1: Table S1, show a comparable D values for pH 4.5 to 7.4 and a lower D for pH 8.5, i.e., 2.90.2.The radiolabeling efficiency increases with the polymer up to a value of 1.1mg/mL, after which the encapsulated percentage remains constant, reaching a plateau at about 30% (Fig.3a). At a block copolymer concentration of 4.3mg/mL, there is an excess of micelles compared to the number of 111In atoms (see Additional file 2 for the calculations), which implies that the labeling efficiency should be independent of the amount of indium. Indeed, the labeling efficiency appears to be the same up to the equivalent activities of 500MBq (see Additional file 3: Figure S1).Fig. 3The radiolabeling efficiency. As function of a PS-b-PEO concentration (0.8mM tropolone and pH 7.4), b tropolone concentration (4.3mg/mL PS-b-PEO and pH 7.4), and c pH (4.3mg/mL PS-b-PEO and 0.8mM tropolone). In all experiments, 50kBq 111In has been used. The uncertainty bars are the standard deviations (N=3)The optimal tropolone concentration has been determined to be between 0.1 and 10mM (Fig.3b). At the lowest tested tropolone concentrations (0.8M), more than 50% of 111In has been found to stick to the glass vial or the stirrer, while above 10-mM free tropolone is expected to compete with 111In-tropolone leading to a decrease in loading.Figure3c shows the effect of the pH on the radiolabeling efficiency, revealing that even at pH 4.5, the labeling efficiency is still 341%, and it remains constant up to pH of 7.4. Only at higher pH values, 8, the efficiency slightly decreases to 294%.As an alternative to the passive loading method, the radiolabeling of preformed micelles, referred to as active loading has also been tested since it has previously been successfully applied in the radiolabeling of liposomes and polymersomes [15]. In active loading, the 111In-tropolone complex in chloroform is added to the preformed micelles to transport the 111In into the core of the micelles. The labeling efficiency of this method has been shown to be somewhat lower than the passive loading, 223% versus up to 322%.Retention of 111InThe loss of radiolabel has been assessed in both phosphate-buffered saline solution and in mouse serum (Fig.4). In saline, the micelles are stable having 954% of the 111In still encapsulated in the micelles after 2days of incubation. The retention of 111In in serum is 833% and 811% after 1 and 2days, respectively. In all samples, the same trend is observed: a fast release rate in 24h followed by a negligible loss in the next 24h.Fig. 4Retention of 111In in micelles as function of time. Polymer concentration 4.3mg/mL, tropolone concentration 0.8M, and 111In activity 50kBq per sample. The uncertainty bars are the standard deviations (N=3)In vivo evaluationDynamic SPECT/CT images in the first 68min pi show that most of the activity is still in circulation (Fig.5). Up to 4h pi circulation is clearly detectable in the scans, making the major blood vessels and the heart chambers visible (Figs.5, 6a, b), while at 24h, the SPECT data suggests that the micelles have primarily accumulated in the spleen and liver and are not found in the blood (Fig.6b, c).Fig. 5Dynamic SPECT/CT scans.

(b) 4h pi: circulation still visible, although reduced in respect to a. c 24h pi: circulation is not visible anymore, while most of the activity is in the spleen and in the liverWhole-body retention of activity at 24h pi has been estimated by measuring radioactivity levels in the extracted blood and the cadavers of euthanized animals, which show that more than 85% of the injected activity has been retained in the body after 24h. Ex vivo biodistribution analysis 24h pi, expressed as a percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g), confirmed the observation made using SPECT/CT imaging, i.e., elevated spleen (17697% ID/g) and liver uptake (306% ID/g) (Fig.7). Surprisingly, although circulation is not detectable via nuclear imaging at 24h pi, the blood samples reveal relatively high percentage of activity (218% ID/g), indicating clearly that the micelles are still in circulation at this time point. The stomach also showed relatively high uptake being on average around 22.96% ID/g.Fig. 7Biodistribution results 24h pi. Bars represent the average values of the calculated % ID/gstandard deviations (N=3)Ex vivo autoradiographyEx vivo autoradiography has been carried out in the sections of the spleen, liver, and kidney. Accumulation in the liver and the kidney tissue appears to be homogeneous. In contrast, the spleen has non-homogenous staining pattern having areas with elevated uptake and smaller zones with lower retention. The observed staining pattern coincides with the anatomical architecture of the spleen with red pulp and white pulp zones, indicating high accumulation in the red pulp and low accumulation in the white pulp (Fig.8).Fig. 8Autoradiogram showing the distribution of 111In-PS-b-PEO micelles in the liver, kidney and spleen 24h pi.

Radiolabeling of polymeric carriers is typically carried out by the conjugation of a chelating molecule on their outer surface which has two main disadvantages: the properties of the nano-entities are altered and therefore possibly their behavior, and radiolabel integrity in vivo is often compromised [16]. For instance, recently, it has been shown that polymersomes composed of the same block copolymer and having the same size exhibit different biodistribution and loss of radiolabel when radiolabeling is on the outer surface versus enclosure in the aqueous cavity of the vesicles. The introduction of a chelating agent (i.e., DTPA) in this case resulted in somewhat negatively charged micelles which led to significantly higher liver uptake than when the PEG chains were not modified, preserving their neutrality [16]. The potential of polymeric micelles as carriers for therapeutic agents, especially when envisioning drug delivery applications, should, hence, be assessed without changing their inherent qualities. In this study, we make use of the physical characteristics of the block copolymer, PS-b-PEO (i.e., high Tg and extreme hydrophobicity) to encapsulate radionuclides in the micellar core, providing a novel and facile radiolabeling method that does not require chemical modifications, keeps the PEO corona intact, and protects the radiolabel from the biological environment.The synthesis of the polymeric micelles is based on the spontaneous self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into micellar structures due to formation of interfacial instabilities in chloroform-in-water emulsion droplets [17]. When the PS-b-PEO block copolymers dispersed in chloroform are emulsified in water, they distribute at the (water-chloroform) interface in order to reduce the entropy of the system, which eventually leads to the formation of micelles as the chloroform evaporates. The mobility of the PS-b-PEO unimers in the micellar core is virtually non-existent due to the glassy behavior of polystyrene, leading to kinetically trapped structures having exceptionally high stability [18]. This micellization process can be used to entrap lipophilic entities, such as in this case tropolone, which are present in the chloroform solution. Tropolone, being a ligand often used in radiolabeling, can be applied to passively bring a radio-metal to the micellar core, which is initially chloroform-rich, provided that the tropolone-metal complex has affinity for chloroform. The final evaporation of chloroform from the micellar structures results then in radiolabeled micelles. In this work, tropolone is complexed with indium (111In) and their distribution ratio has been determined to be above 1, showing a tendency to accumulate in the chloroform phase. Since radiolabeling is in this case a passive process, the radiolabeling efficiency will be limited by the distribution ratio and the amount of chloroform present in the micellar core during micellization, which naturally will depend on the number and size of the micelles. This inherent limitation, however, makes the radiolabeling procedure highly reproducible, since there is only a slight dependence on the different radiolabeling parameters such as polymer, tropolone, and indium concentration, and surprisingly, also pH, as long as sufficient micelles are formed. For instance, the efficiency remains nearly the same for tropolone concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10mM. Only at higher amounts a decrease is seen which is explained by the fact that if there is an excess of free tropolone, i.e., percentage-wise less 111In-labeled tropolone will be encapsulated, assuming that both species behave in a similar way (i.e., have a similar D value). The lack of dependence on indium concentration is logical since there is always a large excess of tropolone and polymer in the studied range, which allows encapsulating sufficient amount of activity at radiolabeling efficiency of 30%. One of the parameters expected to affect the radiolabeling efficiency is the pH, simply based on the pKa value of tropolone and the speciation of indium. In the tested pH range of 4.5 to 8.5, the radiolabeling efficiency remains the same between pH 4.5 and 7.4 and only at pH 8.5 a small decline is observed. The same trend is observed for the distribution ratio, which is constant between pH 4.5 and 7.4 and is lower at pH 8.5. This decrease in the distribution ratio and in the labeling efficiency can be explained by the fact that at alkaline pH \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$ \\mathrm{In}{\\left(\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{H}\\right)}_4^{-} $$\\end{document}InOH4 is formed which is unable to complex with the negatively charged tropolone (see Additional file 4: Figure S2 for the speciation chart). The anticipated reduction of labeling efficiency at lower pH (6.8) based on previous studies and the pKa value of tropolone (i.e., pKa 6.9) have not been observed. The structure of tropolone suggests that it will be partially situated at the water-chloroform interface and as such might have a different pKa value, enabling it to still extract indium even at somewhat acidic pH. This assumption also seems to be supported by the indium retention studies in serum, which reveal initial fast loss of radiolabel in the first 24h followed by nearly no loss of any indium in the following 24h. Such a loss profile can be ascribed to the distribution of In-tropolone in the micelles, i.e., it is very likely that some 111In-tropolone complexes will be situated at the interface between the PEO corona and the PS core and will be much more prone to be taken from the micelles by scavenging proteins. Nevertheless, the loss of radiolabel is still limited (19%) and acceptable.The radiolabeling procedure described in this manuscript is based on some general chemical principles and may be applicable to other block polymers exhibiting similar behavior as PEO-b-PS, i.e., having very slow exchange kinetics. In addition, this procedure would also be suitable for (simultaneous) encapsulation of a variety of radionuclides, provided that they are capable of complexing with tropolone or similarly behaving lipophilic ligands.The success of any micellar formulation in systemic application is mainly dependent on the capacity of carriers to accumulate in diseased tissue with limited retention in healthy organs. The blood residence time has been identified as one of the most crucial aspect in achieving high tumor uptake [19], which in turn depends on the capability of the micelles to escape the body clearance mechanisms. Carriers of the size of PS-b-PEO micelles are usually cleared by macrophages in the liver and spleen, often also referred to as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). PS-b-PEO micelles show a substantial retention in MPS organs, in line with previous observations evaluating the in vivo behavior of other nanoparticles similar in size and composition [20, 21]. In this respect, the morphology of the micelles influences the circulation time and the presence of rod-like micelles in our case might affect the circulation time; however, as the number of elongated species is low, the effect on the average circulation time is considered to be negligible. A particular pattern of accumulation has been observed in the spleen confirming the possible uptake by the splenic resident macrophages as a result of unspecific filtration process [22]. This spleen uptake is in general higher when compared to other block copolymer micelles that have been investigated, which tend to exhibit more pronounced liver uptake [23]. This discrepancy in biodistribution can be due to differences in charge of the investigated systems, and as mentioned earlier, all other systems include chelates present on the surface of the micelles, which typically result in negatively charged micelles. In addition, the rigidity of the PS-b-PEO particles makes them more prone to spleen filtration. Apart from the blood, liver, and spleen, however, all the investigated organs show a low uptake profile (in average below 5% ID/g) and little standard deviations indicative of a differential but homogeneous uptake in the various tissues. The surprisingly elevated stomach uptake is the result of one single animal, which explains as well the high standard deviation reported in the graph. This unexpected finding is probably not the result of tissue uptake/retention but could be ascribed to mice feeding behavior, i.e., daily coprophagy and social grooming [24]. Although we have not determined the half-live of the micelles, the measured retention in blood is at 24h still above 20% ID/g which indicates that a large percentage of the micelles are still in circulation, which is comparable to a number of studies on polymeric micelles [23]. Based on these results, we expect that these micelles will have long enough circulation time to ensure high tumor uptake, which should be further tested in tumor-bearing mice.ConclusionsWe have developed a new, easy, fast, and robust method to produce and radiolabel spherical PS-b-PEO block copolymer micelles. The radiolabeling efficiency is sufficient to achieve micelle activities of up to several hundred megabecquerel. Ex vivo results show blood circulation even 24h pi, with high accumulation in the spleen and liver. Overall, these results are promising for further investigation of radiolabeling polymeric micelles and for the assessment of their fate in vivo.Additional filesAdditional file 1: Distribution ratio of indium-tropolone at pH 4.5 to 8.5.

In this study, a self-assembled pH-sensitive curcumin (Cur)-loaded nanoparticle of 99mTc radiolabeled hyaluronan-cholesteryl hemisuccinate conjugates (HA-CHEMS) and D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) was prepared for breast cancer synergistic theranostics.Materials and MethodsThe synthesized amphiphilic HA-CHEMS conjugates and TPGS self-assembled into Cur-loaded nanoparticles (HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs) in an aqueous environment. The physicochemical properties of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic lighter scattering (DLS). The in vitro cytotoxicity of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs against breast cancer cells was evaluated by using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Moreover, the in vivo animal experiments of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs including SPECT/CT imaging biodistribution and antitumor efficiency were investigated in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice; furthermore, pharmacokinetics were investigated in healthy mice.ResultsHA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs exhibited high curcumin loading, uniform particle size distribution, and excellent stability in vitro. In the cytotoxicity assay, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs showed remarkably higher cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells with an IC50 value at 38 g/mL, compared with free curcumin (77 g/mL). Moreover, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs could be effectively and stably radiolabeled with 99mTc. The SPECT images showed that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs could target the 4T1 tumor up to 4.850.24%ID/g at 4 h post-injection in BALB/c mice. More importantly, the in vivo antitumor efficacy studies showed that HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs greatly inhibited the tumor growth without resulting in obvious toxicities to major organs.ConclusionThe results indicated that HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs with stable 99mTc labeling and high curcumin-loading capacity hold great potential for breast cancer synergistic theranostics.Keywordscurcuminhyaluronannanoparticlecancer theranosticsIntroductionBreast cancer is one of the main threats to womens health and has become the number one cancer among women.1 Chemotherapy, one of the major clinical treatments for breast cancer, still faces many problems, such as poor bioavailability and severe side effects of the active ingredients. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol molecule derived from the Zingiberaceae and Araceae plants has proved to be antineoplastic. However, its clinical application has been limited because of its low solubility and rapid metabolism in vivo.29 In the past decades, nanocarriers have been rapidly developed for drug delivery to increase solubility, prolong duration in vivo, improve tumor-selective cytotoxicity, and reduce drug exposure to normal tissues including polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, and liposomes.1018 Polymeric nanocarriers may be composed of a synthetic polymer or natural polymer, both of which have exhibited good biocompatibility, an easily manipulated chemical structure, and stimuli-responsiveness.1922Hyaluronic acid, also called hyaluronan (HA), a natural polysaccharide, consists of repeating disaccharide units and has been widely used for its biocompatibility. HA can target to CD44-overexpressed solid cancer and cancer stem cells, such as breast, lung, and prostate cancers.2328 By modifying hydrophobic segments, HA-derivatives could self-assemble into nanoparticles that could be used for chemotherapeutics delivery.29,30 For instance, Jeannotet al reported HA-b-poly(-benzyl-L-glutamate) nanoparticles that could actively target to the CD44 receptor for delivery of vorinostat and gefitinib with strong tumor growth inhibition.31 In another example, Gu et al synthesized HA-b-poly(trimethylene carbonate-co-dithiolane trimethylene carbonate) that was capable of high drug loading and tumor-targeted delivery of bortezomib to myeloma in vivo. The HA-based nanoparticles exhibited a broad therapeutic window and enhanced tolerance with more effective growth suppression of CD44-overexpressed tumors.32D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) is a lipophilic polymer derivative of natural vitamin E, it has been approved by the FDA for stabilization in drug delivery systems. Recent studies have shown that TPGS could play a role as an anticancer drug enhancer by inhibiting P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance in multiple tumor cells.3338 However, few investigations have involved the combination functions of therapy and diagnosis.Compared with fluorescence imaging, nuclear imaging provides infinite penetration depth and quantitative capability.39 In particular, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) provides non-invasive detection with high sensitivity and quantification suitable for diagnosis which can be conducive to optimizing the dosing schedule for precise treatment.Technetium-99m (99mTc), obtained from the 99Mo-99mTc generator, is readily available and inexpensive. It has become used daily as a radionuclide in clinics for its favorable physical and chemical properties, including a low energy gamma emission of 140 keV and a half-life of 6 h.40 For example, HA radiolabeled with 99mTc could provide quantitative information on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic of HA.41 By labeling with 99mTc, tumor-targeting nanoparticles could help guide tumor diagnosis. For instance, Polyak et al established a 99mTc radiolabeled nanoparticles that self-assembled by chitosan and folated poly--glutamic acid, which was regarded as a tumor-targeting imaging agent for folate-receptor-overexpressing tumors and exhibited enhanced contrast in mice models.42 With 99mTc radiolabeling, nanoparticles could facilitate non-invasive quantitative diagnosis and allow for personalized treatments by utilizing the same nanoparticles.In our previous study, we synthesized amphiphilic HA-cholesteryl hemisuccinate conjugates that self-assembled into docetaxel-loaded nanoparticles with high drug loading, excellent stability in vitro and efficient antitumor effects.43 In this study, we synthesized HA-CHEMS with 20kd HA, which was higher than the 7.6kd HA which previously reported. The higher molecular weight HA may provide greater charge shielding and higher affinity with CD44 receptors.44 Then, we prepared HA-CHEMS and TPGS nanoparticles as a carrier to deliver curcumin for actively targeting to CD44- overexpressed tumors. Furthermore, radiolabeled with 99mTc, the nanocarrier was developed as a nuclear imaging agent of SPECT imaging and quantification of the tumor targeting ability. On the one hand, HA could serve as a vector that could actively target to CD44-overexpressed tumor cells and tumor stem cells and interfere with endogenous HA-CD44 interaction. On the other hand, curcumin and TPGS could be released by the low pH of lysosome in tumor cells generating the potential for synergistic therapy (Figure 1).Figure 1Schematic illustration of the preparation of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, SPECT imaging and synergistic treatment.Materials and MethodsMaterialsSodium hyaluronic acid (molecular weight: 20 kDa) was provided by Shandong Freda Biopharm Co. Ltd). Sodium pertechnetate (Na99mTcO4) was supplied by Shanghai GMS Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. All chemicals were purchased commercially and used without further purification. The 4T1 mice mammary cancer cells were purchased from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China).Female BALB/C mice (6 weeks of age, 2023 g) of specific pathogen-free grade were received from the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. All of the animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. Ethical approval was obtained for the use of animals in this study from the review board for the Care and Use of Cells/Laboratory Animals of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.Preparation and Characterization of NanoparticlesHA-cholesteryl hemisuccinate (HA-CHEMS) was synthesized via an esterification reaction. Briefly, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (40 mg) and DCC (34 mg) were dissolved in DMSO (2 mL), and then stirred for 4 h at 30 C. Then, HA (160 mg) and DMAP (4 mg) were added to the mixture and reacted for 3d. Thereafter, the mixture was dialyzed in DMSO three times and in water six times, which was followed by lyophilizing. The yield was 90.3%. Moreover, the 1H NMR spectra of HA-CHEM was recorded by UNITYINOVA. (D2O/DMSO-d6, 400MHz, ): HA (1.76, 4.44, and 7.43) CHEMS (5.33).The curcumin-loaded HA-CHEMS and TPGS mixed nanoparticles (HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs) were prepared using the membrane dialysis method as previously described. Briefly, HA-CHEMS (5 mg/mL, 200 L), curcumin (1 mg/mL, 100 L), and TPGS (10 mg/mL, 10 L) were dissolved in DMSO, and then the mixed solution was dropwise injected into a phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.4). After a half hour, the unloaded curcumin and DMSO were removed using dialysis against the PBS (10 mM) for 8 h. The same method was used for the preparation of the HA-CHEMS nanoparticles, HA-CHEMS-TPGS nanoparticles, and curcumin-loaded HA-CHEMS (HA-CHEMS-Cur) nanoparticles.The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). All experiments were conducted on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (a solid-state He-Ne laser (=633 nm)) at 20 C and repeated three times. To visualize the morphology of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, the nanoparticle suspension was dropped on copper grids with films and recorded by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20). The colloidal stability of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was measured for 1 week.For the measurement of entrapment efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL), 0.2 mL of nanoparticles suspension prepared as described above was mixed with 9.8 mL of DMSO. This was followed by sonication disruption for 15 min and centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm. The Cur content in the supernatant was assayed by HPLC.To investigate the release behavior of curcumin from HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs suspension (1 mg/mL, 1 mL) was dialyzed against PBS (10 mM) at a pH of 5.0, 6.5 and 7.4.99mTc Radiolabeling of NanoparticlesStannous chloride (10 L, 1 mg/mL) was added to sodium pertechnetate (Na99mTcO4, 200 Ci) solution and then added to the HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs (100 L, 1 mg/mL). After 30 minutes, the reaction was stopped by adding sodium disulfate (10 L, 10 mg/mL). Finally, the suspension was passed through a PD-10 desalting column to isolate the spare 99mTc. The radiolabeling efficiency was determined by the activity of nanoparticles fraction divided the activity of all fractions. The radiostability was examined using a gel chromatography assay using the PBS as a mobile phase.In vitro CytotoxicityThe 4T1 mice mammary cancer cells were cultured in a Dulbeccos Modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with feta bovine serum (10%, FBS) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C. The previous study demonstrated that the expression level of CD44 was high on the surface of 4T1 cells.The comparison of cytotoxicity of different HA nanoparticles was performed on 4T1 cells. The 4T1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h at 37 C before treatment. Then, the medium was replaced by different nanoparticle suspensions at various curcumin concentrations for 24 h at 37 C. Next, the cells were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (100 L, 0.5 mg/mL) for another 4 h. After that, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance of each well was measured using the microplate reader (Thermo, Vrioskan Flash).SPECT/CT Imaging and Biodistribution in Tumor-Bearing MiceIn vivo imaging was conducted on a microSPECT/CT scanner with an energy window from 120 keV to 160 keV for all scans. The 4T1 cell suspension (5 106cells) was subcutaneously injected into the flank region on the right side of the mouses back to establish the tumor model. When the average volume of the tumor reached 4050 mm3, the tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs (20 mg/kg, 500 Ci) via the tail vein. The scan was performed at predetermined time intervals after administration (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h). As a control, 3 BALB/c mice were injected with HA polymer (1 mg/mL) 1 hour before injection of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs.To study the in vivo plasma pharmacokinetic, blood samples were collected from the retinal veins of healthy BALB/c mice (n = 3) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after injection of the 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs. The radioactivity of blood samples was measured by a counter (Multi Crystal LB 2111 counter). The biodistribution of the 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was studied by measuring the radioactivity of major organs (heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen).In vivo Antitumor Efficacy and ToxicityThe antitumor efficacy was evaluated by using the mouse flank tumor model bearing murine breast 4T1 cells. When the average volume of the tumor reached 4050 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into four groups (n=5), receiving different injections as follows: (1) HA-CHEMS NPs (the control group), (2) HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, (3) HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs, and (4) HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs (50 mg/kg). The nanoparticles were given every 2 days for a total of 5 times. The tumor volume and body weight were measured every 2 days. The survival of mice was also recorded. At the end of the experiment, the tumor and main organs of the mice were sectioned into thin slices for HE and TUNEL staining.Statistical AnalysisOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to evaluate the significance between groups, and post-hoc tests with the Bonferroni correction were used for comparison among individual groups. *p0.05 was considered significant, and **p0.01 were considered highly significant. All data were presented as mean standard deviation.Results and DiscussionPreparation and Characterization of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NanoparticlesHA-CHEMS was obtained by conjugating cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) with HA via an esterification reaction in the presence of DCC, DMAP, and DMSO for 3 days according to our previous protocols (Figure 1). 43 As shown in Figure 2, the 1H-NMR spectrum of HA-CHEMS showed clear peaks at 5.33 ppm that corresponded to CHEMS, and the characteristic signals were of HA (1.76, 4.44 and 7.43 ppm), indicating that HA-CHEMS was successfully synthesized. HA-CHEMS nanoparticles were prepared using the solvent-exchange method to dropwise the HA-CHEMS solution in DMSO to PBS. HA-CHEMS-Cur, HA-CHEMS-TPGS and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were prepared using the same method. In order to optimize the drug loading of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, we investigated the influence of TPGS content on particle size (PS) and drug loading (DL), with the results showing that the increased addition of TPGS could correspondingly increase DL. However, after a certain threshold, excess TPGS obviously increased the particle size but decreased DL. According to the results of the PS and DL of NPs, a HA-CHEMS copolymer and TPGS conjugate ratio of 10:1 (w/w) were determined to be optimal, leading to a DL rate of 8.2% and a corresponding particle size of 144 nm.Figure 21H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, D2O/DMSO-d6) of HA-g-CHEMS.As measured by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) assay, the hydrodynamic diameter of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS nanoparticles was 144 nm, which was similar to the size of HA-CHEMS NPs (Figure 3A). Moreover, the hydrodynamic diameters of HA-CHEMS-Cur and HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs were slight larger than that of the HA-CHEMS nanoparticles. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) picture showed that HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs had a spherical structure with an average size of 98 nm, which was close to the DLS data (Figure 3B). Moreover, the size estimated from TEM was slightly smaller than that obtained from DLS in an aqueous phase, which might be attributed to the shrinkage of the hydrophilic shell during the air-drying process in TEM sample preparation and the system error resulting from the determination principles between DLS (hydrated radius) and TEM.Figure 3Characterization of nanoparticles: (A) Size and distribution as determined by DLS. (B) Morphology of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs as measured by TEM. (C) Colloidal stability at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBS. (D) Release of curcumin at a pH of 5.0, 6.5, and 7.4. (E) The correlation between the radiolabeling efficiency and added activity of 99mTc. (F) The radiostability of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in the PBS and 10% FBS at 37 C (n=3).Remarkably, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs also exhibited good colloidal stability in the PBS with little size change for over 1 week (Figure 3C), which probably was a result of strong interaction between cholesterol molecules and negative zeta potentials (20.141.12 mV) from the ionized carboxylic group of HA in the shell. In addition, the HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs also exhibited comparative negative zeta potentials (21.251.66 mV) with the HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs.The entrapment efficiency and drug loading of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were determined using HPLC up to 84.05.0% and 8.2%. To investigate the in vitro release behavior of curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were dialyzed separately in the PBS at pH 5.0, 6.5, and 7.4. As shown in Figure 3D, the 50.52.4% curcumin was released from HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs at pH 7.4 within 24 h, showing a sustained release behavior. The accumulative release at pH 7.4 was significantly lower than that at pH 6.5 (75.82.1%) and pH 5.0 (80.21.5%). The fast release of curcumin at low pH is likely due to the pH sensitivity of cholesteryl hemisuccinate in HA-CHEMS.45 Cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) synthesized by succinic acid esterified to the L-hydroxyl group of cholesterol is an acidic cholesterol ester that can self-assemble into bilayers in neutral or basic medium. In acidic condition, CHEMS undergoes a phase transformation from the stable lamellar phase at a neutral pH to the unstable inverted hexagonal phase as a result of the protonation of its acidic head group.45,46 This suggests that once the HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs internalized into tumor cells, because of CHEMS, the HA-CHEMS would be hydrolyzed in a lower pH environment of lysosomes (pH5.0), resulting in rapid drug release. In contrast, under the physiological condition (pH7.4), the drug was released slowly from the stable NPs.The radioactive metal 99mTc (t1/2=6 h, E=173 keV) emits gamma-rays, which can be detected by microSPECT. Moreover, metal ions can bind to the carboxyl group of HA and form a stable compound, which may be suitable for 99mTc radiolabeling. To radiolabel HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, SnCl2 was used as a reducing agent and added to 99mTcO4, which eluted from the 99Mo-99mTc generator. A radiolabeling efficiency up to 80.81.7% was achieved, as determined by ultrafiltration. Besides the carboxyl group, two close ester groups also could be used for 99mTc radiolabeling. Tesan et al reported that 99mTc radiolabeled TPGS micelles and displayed excellent radiostability in vivo.47 Hence, the radiolabeling of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs could be explained by the complexation of 99mTc and carboxyl group or two close ester groups. The successful radiolabeling of 99mTc was found to provide an opportunity for radionuclide 188Re to be used as internal radionuclide therapy.48,49 To optimize the 99mTc labeling, varied activity of 99mTc was radiolabeled with a fixed HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs concentration. The radiolabeling efficiency was similar when varying the activity of 99mTc from 0.1 mCi to 1 mCi, which meant that we could radiolabel enough 99mTc for clinical application (Figure 3E). This potentially explains the low chemical amount of 99mTc used for radiolabeling (1 mCi corresponded to 1.9x1011 mol) is sufficient. Maintaining the drug within the nanoparticles for a long time in blood is the prerequisite for drug accumulation in tumor regions and antitumor efficiency. The stability of 99mTc radiolabeling HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS nanoparticles in vitro was investigated by incubation 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs with the PBS and 10% FBS at 37 C with 48 h, respectively. As shown in Figure 3F, less than 10% freedom 99mTc was detected in the PBS and 10% FBS solution by measuring the radioactivity of freedom 99mTc, suggesting a good radiostability for further in vivo study.In vitro Cytotoxicity AssayThe potential cytotoxicity of HA-CHEMS NPs, curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was evaluated in 4T1 cells using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The results showed that no obvious toxicity of HA-CHEMS NPs was observed in 4T1 cells up to a concentration of 1 mg/mL (Figure 4A). Figure 4B shows the toxic effect of free curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs against 4T1 cells for 24 h. All groups displayed a concentration-dependent toxicity of curcumin and TPGS. Furthermore, the IC50 (concentrations of 50% 4T1 cells growth inhibition) values of curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were 77, 58, 103 and 38 g/mL, respectively. Remarkably, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs showed the highest toxicity for 4T1 cells compared to free curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, and HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs, which might be because of the elevated intracellular drug level caused by rapid drug release from nanoparticles after the internalization of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS nanoparticles and the synergistic effect between HA-CHEMS-Cur with TPGS. The combination index (CI) value of HA-CHEMS-Cur and TPGS was calculated as 0.79. Drugs have moderate synergism when the CI value is between 0.6 and 0.8. These results indicated that curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs can inhibit 4T1 cells, and TPGS can enhance antitumor efficiency.Figure 4MTT assays. (A) Viability of 4T1 cell incubated with HA-CHEMS nanoparticles, with concentrations varying from 0 to 1 mg/mL. (B) Viability of 4T1 cell incubated with curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs.In vivo Imaging and PharmacokineticsMicroSPECT imaging of radiolabeled 99mTc was employed to record the in vivo biodistribution and evaluate the tumor-targeting ability of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in 4T1-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. The mice that injected free HA 1 h earlier and followed 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NP injection were regarded as the control. MicroSPECT images showed the biodistribution of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs and control group in 4T1 tumor bearing mice within 24 h (Figure 5A and B). The radioactive intensity at the tumor sites was obviously higher in the 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs group than in the control. The tumor uptake of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs peaked at 4 h post-injection, indicating that HA can actively target to tumor tissue. Meanwhile, no radioactive signal was found in the thyroid, suggesting that the complexation of 99mTc and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS is stable in vivo, the conclusion according to that free 99mTc can be oxidized to 99mTcO4 and accumulate in the thyroid.50,51 Quantitative analysis of microSPECT images showed that the maximum radioactivity intensity of tumor tissue was 4.850.24%ID/g at 4 h post-injection but was less than 1%ID/g in the control group (Figure 5C). Notably, there was more than 3%ID/g of the radioactivity retained in tumor tissue at 8 h post-injection. This result indicated that the nanoparticles can accumulate in a tumor via the enhanced permeation retention (EPR) effect or nanomaterials-induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL).5259 Moreover, a high concentration with prolonged retention of the nanoparticles can provide more drug release to tumor cells and potentially induce more cell death.Figure 5In vivo biodistribution of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in 4T1-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. MicroSPECT/CT of (A) 99mTc- HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs and (B) injection of free HA 1 h earlier and followed by 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs injection at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-injection in mice following the i.v. injection. (C) Percentage of tumor accumulation of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs after intravenous injection. (D) Blood circulation of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs at 24 h post-injection. (E) Biodistribution of major organs measured by -counter at 24 h post-injection.In order to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, healthy mice were intravenously injected with 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs. The blood sample was collected from the retinal vein for radioactivity assay by counter at different post-injection times. The pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs exhibited a prolonged blood circulation time (t1/2, =7.8 h) (Figure 5D). Jin et al found that the half-life of free curcumin was only 8 minutes.60 Hence, the 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs apparently extended the circulation half-life of curcumin from several minutes to several hours. Further, we studied the biodistribution of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in healthy mice. Major organs were excised at 24 h post-injection by intravenous injection via the tail vein. Twenty-four hours post-injection, the main distribution of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs settled more in the liver (19.218.6%ID/g) and spleen (16.247.4%ID/g) compared to other organs such as the heart (0.420.25%ID/g), lung (0.30.1%ID/g), and kidney (0.370.15%ID/g) (Figure 5E). Generally, the nanoparticles were captured by the reticuloendothelial system which is concentrated mainly in the liver and spleen.61,62 However, the total activity of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPS decreased fast, and there was only 20.53.1 ID% left in the mice 24 h post-injection, indicating that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs excretes quickly in normal organs and that the rapid metabolism of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs can decrease cytotoxicity to the health tissue in vivo.In vivo Antitumor EfficacyAfter assessing the targeting ability of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs, the in vivo antitumor efficiency and systemic toxicity of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were evaluated in 4T1-tumor-bearing mice. The tumor volumes and body weights of 4T1- tumor-bearing mice were measured after intravenous administration of HA-CHEMS NPs (control), HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs and two curcumin formulations at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The HA-CHEMS group showed the lowest tumor inhibition effect, with a mean tumor size of 996.8262.3 mm3 at day 12. Unlike HA-CHEMS NPs, the HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs showed a relatively higher effect of tumor reduction, with a mean tumor size of 619.5134.4 mm3 at day 12. Moreover, a recent study showed that TPGS could reverse multidrug resistance by altering the cells membrane and improving cellular uptake.6365 HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs exhibited the highest tumor growth inhibition; the mean tumor size was only 435.587.3 mm3 at day 12. After the 12th day, the growth of tumors in all groups was faster than the growth during the treatment since we stopped injection of nanoparticles on the 10th day. The biodistribution study demonstrated that the retention of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was only 0.880.18 ID%/g in the tumor after 24 h. The uncontrolled tumor growth could be due to the depletion of nanoparticles. Hence, HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs exhibited significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, and HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs (Figure 6A). The antitumor efficacy results indicated that TPGS can enhance the curcumin antitumor efficacy in vivo. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the treatment of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs resulted in a significantly longer median survival time than the other three groups (Figure 6B). Moreover, all treated groups of mice displayed no severe weight loss, indicating that nanoparticles have little systematic toxicity (Figure 6C). Figure 6D shows the tumor blocks at 14 days after treatment, and the results suggested that HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs have better antitumor efficiency than HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs.Figure 6In vivo antitumor performance of nanoparticles in 4T1-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice.

(B) Survival curves of mice after 24 days. (C) Body weight changes of mice. (D) Photographs of tumor blocks collected from different treatments groups on day 14.To further evaluate antitumor efficiency and in vivo cytotoxicity, tumor and major organs were sliced for histological analysis by using HE and TUNEL staining. After staining with HE, the HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs group showed more necrosis in the tumor site compared to the HA-CHEMS NPs, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs and HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs groups (Figure 7A). Furthermore, the TUNEL assay revealed that the HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs group induced more apoptosis of tumor cells (Figure 7A). All the groups showed little damage in major organs (Figure 7B). Cumulatively, the results indicated that HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs are an excellent antitumor nanomedicine for breast cancer with enhanced tumor-specific accumulation, improved antitumor efficiency, and low side effects.Figure 7HE and TUNEL staining assays of tumor (A) and health organs (B) in different treatment groups. All the scale bars present 100 m.ConclusionIn this study, we successfully prepared 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs for synergistic chemotherapy and conducted nuclear imaging for breast cancer in mice. The HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs exhibited a uniform particle size distribution, excellent in vitro stability and high radiolabeling efficiency with good radiostability. Furthermore, the in vivo SPECT imaging demonstrated that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs could actively target to breast cancer in mice. The retention of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was higher than 3%ID/g until 8 h post-injection, with fast total body excretion. The antitumor inhibition results confirmed that the antitumor efficiency of curcumin was elevated with the help of TPGS without obviously toxicity compared with HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs. The findings indicated that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs with excellent CD44 active targeting, effective tumor inhibition, and nuclear imaging can serve as a novel platform for breast cancer theranostics.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81703709, 81703425), the Project Funds from Science and Technology Council of Liaoning Province (No. 2019-ZD-0433) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (No. 2018M641716).DisclosureFen Chen is employed by Zhejiang Jingxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

To further promote the clinical application of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and provide guidance for future research, we need to examine their specific biodistribution in vivo. In this study, K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were effectively labeled by a direct method with Technetium-99m (99mTc) using stannous chloride as a reducing agent. The optimal stability of the labeled nanoparticles was determined by evaluating their radiochemical purity in serum, physiological saline, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and cysteine solutions. The affinity of ligands and receptors was elicited by cell binding and blocking experiments in KDR/folate receptor high expressing SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. The nanoparticles biodistribution was studied after intravenous administration in healthy mice xenografted with SKOV-3 cells. A higher percent injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) was observed in liver, kidney, spleen, blood and tumor at 3 and 9 h post-injection. Scintigraphic images revealed that the radioactivity was mainly concentrated in tumor, liver, kidney and bladder; and in the heart, lung, and muscle was significantly lower at 3 h. The radioactivity distribution in the images is consistent with the in vivo biodistribution data. Our works demonstrated that K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles have great potential as biodegradable drug carriers, especially for tumors expressing the folate and KDr receptor.K237folatePEG-PLGAnanoparticlesbiodistributionINTRODUCTIONTechnetium-99m (99mTc; half-life, 6.02 h; -energy, 140.5 KeV) is a commonly used nuclide in biodistribution, drug tracing and molecular imaging applications due to its low cost, excellent availability, little impact on drug biochemical properties, photon energy that is nearly ideal for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and low absorbed-dose burden to the patients.In this study, an amphiphilic polymer, namely peptides K237 (HTMYYHHYQHHL) (target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, abbreviation: VEGFR-2 or KDR) and folic acid (FA) modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (K237/FA-PEG-PLGA), was used to prepare nanoparticles (NPs) which can serve as favorable carriers for the delivery of certain drugs [14]. In this delivery system, the covalent conjugation of K237 and FA to the NPs confers them the ability to actively bind the KDR receptor and folate receptor (FR). Binding to the receptors leads to a greater uptake of the NPs by KDR/FR-overexpressing tumor cells while virtually ignoring normal tissues, thereby, increasing tumor cell specificity, greatly enhancing antitumor efficacy, and dramatically reducing potentially dangerous side effects [58]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) functions as the outer corona and prolongs the circulation time of the NPs in blood by reducing non-specific interactions with blood components [917]. The PLGA hydrophobic component serves as a reservoir for lipophilic drug, while the anionic component provides the ability to strong electrostatic interaction with cationic drugs [18, 19]. However, the biodistribution of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs has not yet been specifically and quantized studied in ovarian cancer model by using radioisotope 99mTc. Accordingly, we used the radioisotope 99mTc to label the delivery system and study the distribution of radioactivity in various tissues following administration of the labelled NPs by performing gamma imaging of the whole body at predetermined time point.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhysics characterization of NPsThe K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs have a rigid structure due to ionic interaction among the base amino groups at the amino-terminus of PEG-PLGA. The mean diameter of the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) NPs was 128.7 13.9, 114.6 10.3, and 104.2 9.6 nm, respectively, and the potential was 23.53 2.79, 18.71 1.84, and 16.91 2.08 mV, respectively. Meantime, the polydispersity was 0.18 0.03, 0.17 0.03 and 0.14 0.02. respectively. The mean size and polydispersity index values indicate the narrow size and homogenous distributions of the particles. The potential values indicate the stability of the nanodispersions. The presence of PEG chains in the outer shell layer was used to improve the stability and biocompatibility of the NPs [2023]. A TEM photograph, presented in Figure 1, shows that the NPs were approximately round, smooth, uniform size and exhibited no agglomeration. And there were not obvious changes after 99mTc label NPs.Figure 1TEM and DLS characterization of the NPsThe K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40) NPs (A) and 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40) NPs (B) are spherical and uniform size. K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40) NPs have a diameter of about 130 nm (C), and negative zeta potential (D).Radiolabeling of NPs with 99mTcThe NPs were labeled with 99mTc with a high labeling efficiency by a direct method. In the labeling process, the amount of stannous chloride and pH value were critical factors influencing labeling efficiency. The amount of stannous chloride affected the ratio of reduced/hydrolyzed (R/H) 99mTc and free 99mTc. Thus, higher amounts of stannous chloride could lead to formation of radioactive colloids which are undesirable, while lower amounts of stannous chloride could lead to poor labeling efficiency. The influence of stannous chloride on the labeling efficiency and the R/H of 99mTc is shown in Table 1. In this study, the aim was to determine the optimal amount of stannous chloride required for higher labeling efficiency with lower free 99mTc and R/H of 99mTc. The study found that 20 g was the optimal amount required for all NPs preparations. The optimal pH value and incubation time of the NPs, which can obtain high labeling efficiency, was 7.0 and 15 min, respectively. To optimize the above parameters, quality control tests were performed by TLC using ITLC strips.Table 1Influence of the amount of stannous chloride on the labeling efficiency of NPsSnCl22H2O (g)203050100K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40)% Labeled (mean SD)97.95 1.1395.88 2.7394.3 1.9086.92 2.85% colloids (mean SD)0.37 0.351.16 0.871.77 0.552.71 1.83% free (mean SD)1.68 0.442.96 1.073.93 1.6110.37 3.32K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 70/30)% Labeled (mean SD)96.56 3.6694.12 3.1293.58 3.1684.12 3.24% colloids (mean SD)1.08 0.362.03 0.822.37 1.004.06 2.75% free (mean SD)2.36 1.423.75 1.284.05 0.7811.82 2.47K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20)% Labeled (mean SD)95.40 2.2994.39 1.9393.26 3.1982.98 2.70% colloids (mean SD)1.73 0.722.099 0.542.56 0.824.75 2.50% free (mean SD)2.87 0.723.52 1.864.18 2.0412.27 3.43Stability of labeled NPs in vitroThe 99mTc-labeled NPs were assessed for their stability in vitro after incubation with healthy human serum and 0.9% NaCl solutions. These conditions were selected to mimic the in vivo internal environment, physiological pH, in vitro storage and applied environment. The human serum contains many kinds of proteins which can chelate and bind to 99mTc, affect the stability of the labeled NPs in blood when the labeled NPs are injected intravenously. If the labeled NPs were stable in serum, markers can be used for in vivo biodistribution studies.The labeling efficiency of the three kinds of NPs, namely LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30 and 80/20, in a 0.9% NaCl solution was 95.1%, 94.26%, 93.03%, respectively, at 4 h, and 89.74%, 90.63%, 90.05%, respectively, at 24 h (Figure 2A). The labeling efficiency in serum was 94.28%, 94.67%, 93.95%, respectively, at 4 h, and 88.94%, 89.53%, 88.31%, respectively, at 24 h (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the three kinds of NPs were quite stable in serum and normal saline within 24 h.Figure 2In vitro stability studies of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs in (A) physiological saline and (B) human serumDTPA and cysteine challengeThe strength of the 99mTc binding to NPs in 99mTc-labeled NPs was tested with 10, 30, 50 mM of DTPA or cysteine, which may indirectly confirm that no trans-chelation of the metal occurred in such physiological environment. The results indicated that the labeling efficiency of the NPs was not altered much in presence of DTPA (Figure 3A) or cysteine (Figure 3B). Indeed, an evaluation of these results revealed that only 1%2% transchelation occurred when incubated with 10 mM of DTPA or cysteine; while incubation for 1 h with 50 mM of DTPA or cysteine, the transchelation was only around 45% with DTPA and less than 4% with cysteine, indicating the high stability of the labeled NPs.Figure 3Determination of the in vitro stability of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) NPs by the (A) DTPA and (B) cysteine challenge testCell binding and blocking experiments in vitroThe binding specificity of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs to the SKOV-3 cell line is shown in Tables 24. The results of the binding specificity tests indicated that the binding of the 99mTc-labeled NPs to FR-expressing cells was receptor-mediated, because the receptors could be blocked and their saturation by pre-incubation with an excess of FA can significantly decreased the binding of the radiolabeled NPs. However, the amount of the free 99mTcO4 binding to cells was negligible. The cell-associated immune activity of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) NPs binding to the SKOV-3 cell line was 31.75%, 32.79% and 34.01%, respectively. The highest specific binding rate of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) NPs binding to SKOV-3 cells was 32.28%, 34.13%, 36.72%, respectively. Additionally, the total and specific binding rates declined with a decrease of the density of the SKOV-3 cells. These results indicate that the labeled NPs have good bioactivity and specificity. Specifically, the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs have the best bioactivation and specificify of the three kinds of NPs evaluated, although the difference was not statistically significant.Table 2The 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40) NPs binding rate (%) of SKOV-3 cellsNumber of SKOV-3 cells99mTcO4LA/GA = 60/40Total bindingNon-specific bindingSpecific binding5 1062.59 0.4736.14 1.03.86 0.1332.281 1062.30 0.2133.41 0.183.57 0.129.841 1051.89 0.5330.48 1.102.52 0.3227.965 1041.58 0.5525.89 1.701.69 0.0624.21 1041.62 0.7121.37 1.501.74 0.8819.63Table 3The 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 70/30) NPs binding rate (%) of SKOV-3 cellsNumber of SKOV-3 cellsLA/GA = 70/30Total bindingNon-specific bindingSpecific binding5 10637.89 0.673.76 0.2134.131 10635.99 2.093.69 0.2032.31 10529.65 1.462.93 0.1626.725 10424.73 0.502.09 0.0322.641 10420.75 1.911.71 0.2519.04Table 4The 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs binding rate (%) of SKOV-3 cellsNumber of SKOV-3 cellsLA/GA = 80/20Total bindingNon-specific bindingSpecific binding5 10640.56 2.313.84 0.4736.725 10533.08 0.573.34 0.4029.741 10529.95 1.522.83 0.0227.125 10427.17 1.082.26 0.0624.911 10421.85 0.821.92 0.7919.93In vivo studiesBiodistribution studiesData on the comparative biodistribution of the 99mTc-labeled NPs in male BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with SKOV-3 cells at 3, and 9 h are presented in Table 5. The average radioactivity in the liver, and spleen, was 23.1 and 13.28%, respectively, at 3 h, and 6.50 and 2.45%, respectively, at 9 h. The 99mTc- K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs were found to be mainly concentrated in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The low level of radioactivity detected in the stomach suggests that the release of 99mTc in vivo was negligible. The high radioactivity in kidney, indicates that the 99mTc-labeled NPs were mainly metabolized through the urinary system. Meanwhile, the high radioactivity detected in blood, reveals the long cycle effects of the NPs, and suggests that it may be better to target tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and the binding of ligand and receptor.Table 5Biodistribution of the 99mTc-labeled NPs in male BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing SKOV-3 Xenografts, at 3 and 9 hours after intravenous injectionOrganUptake (% ID/g)Tumor-to-organ ratio3 h9 h3 h9 hLiver23.1 1.846.50 1.110.920.95Kidney22.73 2.906.23 0.960.930.99Spleen13.28 0.812.45 0.69*1.62.51Blood13.18 0.42*2.20 0.66*1.612.79Stomach4.31 0.20*0.89 0.394.936.9Lung0.88 0.04*0.16 0.06*24.1638.38Tumor21.26 1.276.14 1.45Bone0.48 0.14*0.07 0.03**44.2987.71Thyroid0.44 0.02*0.12 0.04**48.3251.17Heart0.41 0.12*0.09 0.02**51.8568.22Intestines0.40 0.14*0.11 0.04*53.1555.82Muscle0.23 0.07*0.04 0.01**92.44153.5*Significant difference of the % ID/g between tumor and other organs (p 0.05).**Significant difference of the % ID/g between tumor and other organs (p 0.01).% ID/g = percent injected dose per gram of tissue.-Camera imagingThe scintigraphic images of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA =80/20) NPs were acquired at 3 and 9 h (Figure 4) after tail vein injection, and confirmed the results of the biodistribution experiments. These images reveal the high level of radioactivity accumulation in tumor, liver, kidney and bladder. The results of the region of interest (ROI), show that the T/NT of tumor and contralateral muscle conforms to the biodistribution experiments. The uptake of radioactivity by the bone marrow of the mice injected with 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs was low. Additionally, compared with the radioactivity accumulation at 3 h, after 9 h of the tail vein administration of the labeled NPs, the distribution in vivo was the same as the 3 h and the radioactivity was decreased in the liver, kidney, bladder and tumor.Figure 4-scintigraphic image of the SKOV3-bearing mice after 3 hours (A) and 9 hours (B) of the i.v. injection of 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPsCONCLUSIONSK237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs with narrow size and homogenous distribution were successfully prepared using the W/O and solvent evaporation method. The NPs loaded with drug were also prepared using a similar method [24]. These approaches can be an alternative to improve the stability and solubility of drug, while enhancing the absorption and bioavailability of the loaded-drug by tumors. The K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs were labeled with 99mTc using a rapid and simple direct labeling procedure to achieve high labeling efficiency and stability within 24 h. Relatively high radioactivity were observed in blood, liver, kidney and tumor after i.v. administration, and high retention in blood were advantageous to increase the loaded-drug residence time. Scintigraphic images showed that the maximum uptake occurred in liver, kidney and tumor. In conclusion, the NPs could be a potential ideal drug delivery system (DDS) to improve the efficacy of the loaded-drug and reduce drug-associated toxic and side effects during cancer treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsPEG, molecular weight (Mw) 2000, was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd.

All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Fudan University.Synthesis of the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA polymerThe synthesis of the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) polymer (Mw 12,000) has been described in detail elsewhere [2831], following the steps depicted in Scheme 1. In brief, (1) the hydroxyl-terminated PEG-PLGA was synthesized; (2) the hydroxyl end-group was then converted to Boc-L-Phe; (3) the t-Butoxycarbonyl end-group was removed, followed by the synthesis of the amino-terminated PEG-PLGA; (4) the amino-terminated PEG-PLGA (200 mol) was dissolved in DMSO (60 mL), then mixed with NHS (1,000 mol), DIC (1,000 mol), K237 (500 mol) and FA (500 mol) at 37C. Following 24 hours incubation, the solution was mixed with 200 mL of distilled water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was then collected, dialyzed and freeze-dried. The obtained product was dissolved in DMSO and the concentration of the conjugated k237/FA was determined. Various concentrations of K237/FA in DMSO were used as reference.Preparation of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPsThe K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs were prepared using a water in oil (W/O) emulsion method. Briefly, 4 mg of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA were dissolved in 200 L of ethyl acetate, followed by the addition of 2.0 ml of deionized water containing 1% (W/W) of F68. Subsequently, the mixture was homogenized and emulsified by ultrasonication (400 W, 6 times 10s) with a JY 92-II ultrasonic processor (Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co, Ltd, China). The resulting emulsion was rotated and evaporated under 0.5 MPa and 37C. After 30 min, the emulsion was stirred gently at room temperature to evaporate the left organic solvent. Finally, the NPs were isolated by centrifugation at 15000 rpm, at 4C for 30 min, and the pelleted NPs were freeze dried [32, 33].Physical characterizationThe particle size and zeta potential () of the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs were characterized using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). The average diameters and size distribution parameters of the NPs were obtained by dynamic light scattering. The was determined under a He-Ne laser beam at a wavelength of 633.8 nm at room temperature.The morphology of the NPs was examined with an H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) from Hitachi Ltd., (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were prepared by depositing 10 L of NPs suspension on a 200 mesh, copper grid with a formvar film, and then air-drying at room temperature [3437].Radiolabeling of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs with 99mTcRadiolabeling of the NPs was performed by a direct method using stannous chloride as a reducing agent. The effect of the amount of NPs and stannous chloride, the final pH of the preparation and the incubation time on the labeling efficiency was previously optimized by changing a parameter at a time and by performing quality-control tests for the labeled complex as described earlier [38]. The amount of stannous chloride required for high labeling efficiency and low radio colloids was optimized in preliminary experiments, whereby it was determined that a range of 20 to 100 g of stannous chloride was optimal and thus was used in further experiments. Similarly to achieve optimal labeling efficiency, the amount of NPs, the pH of the reaction mixture and the incubation time were also investigated. Eventually, the most appropriate labeling protocol was found and can be described as follows. Briefly, 250 L of NPs dispersion (2 mg/mL) were mixed separately with 20 g of stannous chloride (40 mg/mL). After adjusting the pH of the mixture to 7.0 with sodium hydrogen carbonate (0.5 M), 50 L of a 99mTcO4 solution (0.743.7 GBq), freshly eluted from a 99Mo-99mTc generator (Drytec, GE Healthcare), was added to each preparation, mixed gentle, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Final radioactivity concentration present in the preparation was examined using a well-type gamma ray spectrometer (Cobra II Inspector 5003; Canberra Packard Central Europe GmbH, Romania) [39].Determination of labeling efficiencyThe labeling efficiency of the NPs was determined by ascending thin layer chromatography (TLC) using instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) strips coated with silica gel and the test temperature was 25C. The ITLC strips were used to determine the free 99mTc and percentage of radio colloids in the preparation. Based on these two parameters, the labeling efficiency of the preparation was calculated [40].ITLC strips were spotted with 2~3 L labeled complex at 1 cm above the bottom. These strips were advanced by using acetone as the mobile phase to determine the percentage of the labeled complex and a solvent (Vpyridine: Vacetic acid: Vwater = 3:5:1.5) as the mobile phase to determine free 99mTc and labeled NPs. The solvent front was allowed to reach to a height of approximately 6 to 8 cm from the origin. The radioactivity in the strip of Rf value = 0.1 to 1.0 was determined by well-type gamma ray spectrometer. The free 99mTc present in the preparation migrates to the top portion (Rf value about 0.8 to 1.0) of the ITLC strip, leaving the labeled NPs along with the radio colloids (reduced/hydrolyzed 99mTc) at the application point when using acetone as the mobile phase. The presence of radio colloids was determined by developing the ITLC strip using a solution of pyridine: acetic acid: water in volume proportion of 3:5:1.5. The reduced/hydrolyzed 99mTc present in the preparation remains at the point of application, while both the free 99mTc and labeled NPs migrate to the front with the solvent front [38]. The labeling efficiency was calculated by using the following equation:Labeling efficiency (%) = [Bacetone/(T+B)acetone Tpyridine/(T+B) pyridine] 100%. Where, T and B are the radioactivity counts at the top and bottom of the strip, respectively.Stability of labeled complexesThe stability of the 99mTc-labeled NPs was evaluated in vitro in human serum and normal saline by the ascending TLC technique. The freshly labeled complex (10 L) was incubated with freshly collected human serum (90 L) at 37C. Following incubations for 1 h, 4 h, 9 h and 24 h, the samples were separated by ITLC using the above mentioned solvent systems.DTPA and cysteine challengeThe in vitro stability studies of 99mTc-labeled NPs were performed using DTPA and cysteine as previously reported [24]. Briefly, fresh DTPA and cysteine solutions (10, 30, 50 mM, each) were prepared in 0.9% NaCl solutions. A 500 L volume of the labeled NPs was incubated with the different concentrations of DTPA and cysteine for 1h at 37C, while a 500 L of 0.9% NaCl solution served as control. The effect of DTPA and cysteine on the labeling efficiency of the prepared complexes was analyzed by ITLC-silica gel strips using acetone as mobile phase. In this acetone system, the 99mTc-labeled NPs remain at the point of application (Rf = 0.0), while free pertechnetate (Rf = 0.81.0) and all known chemical forms of 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-cysteine complexes migrate upward (Rf = 0.71.0). After developing, each paper was cut into two halves, the top and bottom halves, and radioactivity in each half was measured using a gamma-ray spectrometer [41, 42].Scheme 1Schematic depiction of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA copolymer synthesisCell binding and blocking experiments in vitroThe specificity of the 99mTc-labeled NPs for receptor was assessed in vitro. SKOV-3 cells in the logarithmic phase of proliferation, 8090% confluency, were detached with trypsin and resuspended at a cell concentration of 5 106, 1 106, 5 105, 1 105, 5 104, 1 104 cells/mL. A volume of 1 mL of cell suspension was transferred into a centrifuge tube, then 1.5 g (0.37-2.22 MBq, 100 L) of 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs in DMEM solution was added to each tube, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37C, before the radioactivity count (T) was measured. Cells were collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm/min) for 10 min, at 4C, washed twice with PBS (0.01 mol/L, pH = 7.4), and then the radioactivity of the combination with SKOV-3 cells (B) was measured. Meanwhile, non-specific binding assay was performed as above described. A total of 191 g of FA (equivalent to 1000 times, compared with FA in 1.5 g nanoparticles) were added to the different cell samples, followed by the addition of the same amount of 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs after incubation for 45 min at 37C. After 1 h, the samples were centrifuged (3000 rpm/min) for 10 min, cells were collected and wash twice with PBS (0.01 mol/L, pH = 7.4), and then the radioactivity was measured. The specific cells binding rate (%) = the mean of total cells binding rate (B/T) the mean of non-specific cells binding rate [4346]. The cells binding rate of the 99mTcO4 was determined as follows: a 100 L (0.372.22 MBq) of 99mTcO4 solution was added to the cells suspension solution, then the other steps were as described above.In vivo studiesBiodistribution studiesPrevious studies have revealed that K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) has better physicochemical properties and biocompatibility [2730, 4749]. Accordingly, the tumor-targeting properties of the preparations with the most favorable biodistribution, K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs was studied in mice xenografted with SKOV-3 cells. For inoculation, SKOV-3 cells (1 106) were implanted in the right hind leg of immunodeficient mice [5052]. Additionally, 3.7 MBq of 99mTc-labeled K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs in 150 L of normal saline were administered into the mice tail vein. At 3 h and 9 h post-injection mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and tissue were dissected for measurement of biodistribution and tumor targeting. The radioactivity associated with the blood, heart, liver, kidney, tumor, lung, spleen, stomach, muscle, and bone tissues were examined with a gamma counter, together with a standard radioactive solution of known quantity administered at the time of each injection, which was considered as 100%. The radioactivity present in each tissue sample was expressed as percent injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) (n = 6) [53, 54].-Camera imagingIn vivo imaging was performed to obtain a visual confirmation of the biodistribution data. The SKOV-3 xenograft-bearing mice were injected with 100 Ci of 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs. Before imaging, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 18.75 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 0.5 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride. The accumulation of radioactivity in mice was monitored by imaging with a -camera (GE Healthcare, Cleveland, OH, USA) equipped with a low-energy high-resolution collimator. Static images were obtained by a 512512 matrix and a pixel side length of 0.4 mm, resulting in a total imaging time of 757 seconds. [5558]StatisticsStatistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All results are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) for the values obtained from a minimum of three independent experiments. All statistical analyses involving comparisons of multiple groups were performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc test. All tests were considered statistically significant when the P value was less than 0.05.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe work was supported by the funding from Wenzhou Science Technology Bureau (No. Y20150049) and NSFC projects (No. 81602727 and No. 81501483).REFERENCES1WangHXieHWuJWeiXZhouLXuXZhengSStructure-based rational design of prodrugs to enable their combination with polymeric nanoparticle delivery platforms for enhanced antitumor efficacyAngew Chem Int Ed Engl2014531153211537251964272LiYJDongMKongFMZhouJPFolate-decorated anticancer drug and magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated polymeric carrier for liver cancer therapeuticsInt J Pharm20154898390258888013SinghRKesharwaniPMehraNKSinghSBanerjeeSJainNKDevelopment and characterization of folate anchored Saquinavir entrapped PLGA nanoparticles for anti-tumor activityDrug Dev Ind Pharm20154118881901257388124WeiKPengXZouFFolate-decorated PEG-PLGA nanoparticles with silica shells for capecitabine controlled and targeted deliveryInt J Pharm2014464225233244630735ShenJPuttKSVisscherDWMurphyLCohenCSinghalSSanduskyGFengYDimitrovDSLowPSAssessment of folate receptor- expression in human neoplastic tissuesOncotarget20156147001470910.18632/oncotarget.3739259092926ShiFanCoffeyAaron M.WaddellKevin W.ChekmenevEduard Y.GoodsonBoyd M.Nanoscale Catalysts for NMR Signal Enhancement by Reversible ExchangeThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C2015119752575337IwamotoTakuyaOgawaYutaSunLinaWhiteMatthew SchuetteGlowackiEric DanielScharberMarkus ClarkSariciftciNiyazi SerdarMansekiKazuhiroSugiuraTakashiYoshidaTsukasaElectrochemical Self-Assembly of Nanostructured CuSCN/Rhodamine B Hybrid Thin Film and Its Dye-Sensitized Photocathodic PropertiesThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C201411816581165908WangHYinHYanFSunMDuLPengWLiQFengYZhouYFolate-mediated mitochondrial targeting with doxorubicin-polyrotaxane nanoparticles overcomes multidrug resistanceOncotarget201562827284210.18632/oncotarget.3090256050189HuXGongXA new route to fabricate biocompatible hydrogels with controlled drug delivery behaviorJ Colloid Interface Sci201647062702693054110WangHXieHWuJWeiXZhouLXuXZhengSStructure-based rational design of prodrugs to enable their combination with polymeric nanoparticle delivery platforms for enhanced antitumor efficacyAngew Chem Int Ed Engl20145311532115372519642711GongXGaoCInfluence of salt on assembly and compression of PDADMAC/PSSMA polyelectrolyte multilayersPhys Chem Chem Phys20091111577115862002443012WangJWangHLiJLiuZXieHWeiXLuDZhuangRXuXZhengSiRGD-Decorated Polymeric Nanoparticles for the Efficient Delivery of Vandetanib to Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Preparation and in Vitro and in Vivo EvaluationACS Appl Mater Interfaces2016819228192372738149313HuangYJiangYWangHWangJShinMCByunYHeHLiangYYangVCCurb challenges of the Trojan Horse approach: smart strategies in achieving effective yet safe cell-penetrating peptide-based drug deliveryAdv Drug Deliv Rev201365129913152336982814YuZXuQDongCLeeSSGaoLLiYD'OrtenzioMWuJSelf-Assembling Peptide Nanofibrous Hydrogel as a Versatile Drug Delivery PlatformCurr Pharm Des201521434243542632341915YuZCaiZChenQLiuMYeLRenJLiaoWLiuSEngineering -sheet peptide assemblies for biomedical applicationsBiomater Sci201643653742670020716YuZSchmaltzRMBozemanTCPaulRRishelMJTsosieKSHechtSMSelective tumor cell targeting by the disaccharide moiety of bleomycinJ Am Chem Soc2013135288328862337986317SequeiraGonzaloVanzulliSilvia IRojasPaolaLambCarolineColomboLucasMayMaraMolinoloAlfredoLanariClaudiaThe effectiveness of nano chemotherapeutic particles combined with mifepristone depends on the PR isoform ratio in preclinical models of breast cancerOncotarget201453246326010.18632/oncotarget.19222491277418OlaldeB.AizpuruaJ.
