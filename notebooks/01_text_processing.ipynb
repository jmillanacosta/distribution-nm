The as-synthesized bMSNs are intrinsically radiolabeled with oxophilic zirconium-89 (<sup>89</sup>Zr, <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 78.4 h) radionuclide to track their in vivo pharmacokinetics via positron emission tomography imaging. Rapid and persistent CD105 specific tumor vasculature targeting is successfully demonstrated in murine model of metastatic breast cancer by using TRC105 (an anti-CD105 antibody)-conjugated bMSNs. This study serves to illustrate a simple, versatile, and readily tunable approach to potentially overcome the current challenges facing nanomedicine and further the goals of personalized nanotheranostics."
