Rapid and persistent CD105 specific tumor vasculature targeting is successfully demonstrated in murine model of metastatic breast cancer by using TRC105 (an anti-CD105 antibody)-conjugated bMSNs. This study serves to illustrate a simple, versatile, and readily tunable approach to potentially overcome the current challenges facing nanomedicine and further the goals of personalized nanotheranostics."
