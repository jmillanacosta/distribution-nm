      "A systematic study of in vitro and in vivo behavior of biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs), designed to carry multiple cargos (both small and macromolecular drugs) and subsequently self-destruct following release of their payloads, is presented. Complete degradation of bMSNs is seen within 21 d of incubation in simulated body fluid. The as-synthesized bMSNs are intrinsically radiolabeled with oxophilic zirconium-89 (<sup>89</sup>Zr, <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 78.4 h) radionuclide to track their in vivo pharmacokinetics via positron emission tomography imaging. Rapid and persistent CD105 specific tumor vasculature targeting is successfully demonstrated in murine model of metastatic breast cancer by using TRC105 (an anti-CD105 antibody)-conjugated bMSNs. This study serves to illustrate a simple, versatile, and readily tunable approach to potentially overcome the current challenges facing nanomedicine and further the goals of personalized nanotheranostics.\n"

Engineering Intrinsically Zirconium89 Radiolabeled SelfDestructing Mesoporous Silica Nanostructures for In Vivo Biodistribution and Tumor Targeting Studies. Adv. Sci., 3: 1600122. doi: 10.1002/advs.201600122 1IntroductionInorganic nanomaterials have rapidly gained momentum in nanomedicine due to their unique physicochemical properties and partly due to their facile synthesis, biofunctionalization, and ease of loading a wide range of therapeutics.1 However, only a few have advanced beyond preclinical studies and even fewer have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical purposes.2, 3 An ideal theranostic nanoparticle is one which is safe and nonimmunogenic, can rapidly and specifically accumulate in the diseased tissue, map the biomedical/morphological status of the tissue, effectively deliver the therapy, and be degraded or cleared from the body in a reasonable time period.1 In this regard, biodegradable and renally clearable nanoparticles have emerged as frontrunners.4 While renal clearable nanomaterials (with a hydrodynamic diameter typically less than the glomerular threshold limit of 7 nm) alleviate the longterm toxicity concerns, great challenges still exist in engineering ultrasmall multifunctional nanoparticles with tunable blood circulation halflife, specific, enhanced, and persistent tumor accumulation, etc.4 Thus, a novel nanoplatform with suitable blood residence time and tumorspecific targeting ability in vivo, and that can selfdestruct into small fragments to facilitate clearance might hold greater promise for future clinical translation.Majority of previous reports on nanoparticle mediated drug delivery have been optimized only for smallmolecule drugs, thereby highlighting the urgent need for development of nanocarriers for potent biomacromolecular drugs, a rapidly developing area in cancer therapeutics.5, 6, 7, 8 Despite the therapeutic activity of a single biomacromolecular drug (e.g., small proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.) being equivalent to about 106108 of that a conventional small molecule anticancer agent (e.g., doxorubicin), issues like inefficient delivery to the target site and inability to cross the tumor cell membrane have severely limited their clinical applications.5 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), due to their large specific surface area, pore volume, and welldefined and easily tunable porous structure, have become one of the most intensively studied nanomaterials and have evolved spectacularly in the last two decades.9, 10 Silicon is a wellknown trace element in the human body and silica (i.e., SiO2) has been categorized as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA (ID Code: 14808607).11 Moreover, C dots are the only renal clearable inorganic nanoparticles that have gained Investigational New Drug (IND) approval by the FDA for firstinhuman clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov; ID: NCT01266096, NCT02106598).2, 12, 13 However, suboptimal in vivo pharmacokinetics of most reported MSNs, namely, inefficient tumor targeting and rapid sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system (RES, e.g., liver and spleen), as well as slow degradation and excretion have impeded their translational ability.14 To address these challenges, we propose an improved design for the silica nanoconjugates, wherein they can (1) entrap large molecular drugs, (2) selfdestruct over time, without the aid of any external agent or stimulus, (3) rapidly and specifically accumulate in tumor tissues in vivo, and (4) be tracked over a long period of time using intrinsically labeled zirconium89 (89Zr, t 1/2 = 78.4 h) and highly sensitive and quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.Dendritic, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) were synthesized, with a centrally radiating, twotiered porous network. The large pores (12 nm) served to load macromolecular cargo, as well as accelerate the degradation of the nanoparticles. The abundant deprotonated silanol (SiO) groups in bMSN were harnessed for chelatorfree labeling of oxophilic position emitting isotope (e.g., 89Zr) for tracing the in vivo biodistribution. The design of the nanoconjugates was further optimized for effective enhanced tumor vasculature targeting in 4T1 breast cancer murine models.2Results and Discussion2.1Synthesis and Characterization of bMSNsUniformly sized bMSNs with hierarchical dendritic networks were synthesized using a modified oilwater biphase stratification reaction system as reported in literature (see the Experimental Section for details).15 Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1 a) indicate monodispersed mesoporous nanopaticles, 162.9 6.4 nm in diameter bearing a spokelike radiating, rigid mesochanneled internal structure. The results were consistent with the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements which showed bMSNs with a slightly larger hydrodynamic diameter of 190.1 16.9 nm (Figure 1b). Furthermore, the concentration of bMSNs (number of nanoparticles mL1) was determined using the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) method on a NanoSight instrument (Video S1, Supporting Information). Results indicated a highly homogenous population with the estimated value of 8.97 1011 nanoparticles mL1 or 3.59 1014 g1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). These values also corroborated our theoretically calculated number of 9.68 1014 bMSNs g1 (detailed calculations shown in Section S.1, Supporting Information). Based on the Zhuravlev model,16 the concentration of silanol groups was estimated to be 1 107 per nanoparticle (Section S.2, Supporting Information).Figure 1Physicochemical characterization of bMSN. a) TEM image shows an average particle size 160 nm. (Scale bar: 200 nm) Outset schematic depicts the cross section of bMSN showing a twotiered porous structure. The inner pores measure 5.4 nm that continue into outer wider channels 12 nm in diameter.

As apparent from the nitrogen sorption isotherms (Figure 1d), assynthesized bMSNs demonstrate a broad pore size distribution, with the appearance of hysteresis and capillary condensation steps at relative pressures 0.2 P/P 0 0.8. The radial spokelike, twolevel pore structure appeared to possess a central core of densely packed channels (pore size: 5.4 nm) which continued into an outer connected ring of wider channels (pore size: 12.0 nm), seen clearly in Figure 1a. The bimodal pore size distribution was further confirmed by BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) analysis (Figure 1e). In addition, we also observed that using our simplified onepot synthetic protocol, the pore size could be easily tailored by simply altering the precursor (i.e., tetraethyl orthosilicate [TEOS]) to organic solvent (i.e., cyclohexane) ratio and reaction time; thus, bypassing the requirement of different organic solvents as reported previously.15 For example, by reducing the amount of TEOS precursor used (ratio: 1 v/v%) and extending the reaction time to 70 h, bMSNs with particle size of 285 nm and pore size of 17 nm were obtained (Figure S2, Supporting Information).2.2Degradation Study of Silica Nanoparticles (SNs)Rapid sequestration of nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic size larger than 10 nm by the macrophages, and subsequent nonspecific and prolonged residence of these phagocytosed nanoparticles in nontargeted organs (such as liver and spleen) has challenged the effectiveness of nanotheranostics.1 In this regard, selfdestructing silica nanoparticles which degrade into nontoxic and nonimmunogenic byproducts over time, can be a promising platform for nanoparticle based in vivo imaging and drug delivery. To test the degradability of bMSNs, assynthesized nanoparticles were incubated in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 C for a period of 21 d with constant stirring. It is well known that upon intracellular uptake, nanoparticles are routed to lysosome organelles, which are primary sites of intracellular sequestration and degradation of foreign particles and pathogens.17 Accordingly, the pH of the soaking solution was tuned to 45 to mimic the natural lysosomal environment. Aliquots were drawn at frequent intervals and centrifuged at high speed. The pellet was observed using TEM and the supernatant was analyzed with microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MPAES) to assess the Si concentration. Distinct changes in nanoparticle morphology could be observed within 1 d postincubation, when the outer edges began to erode into rougher surfaces (Figure 2 a, Day 1). The degradation accelerated thereafter and subsequent signs of obvious degradation could be seen at day 3 (Figure 2a, Day 3). 19.0 0.1% of the initial Si ion concentration was released into the SBF solution within 3 d of incubation. Erosion progressed inward from the outer edges, resulting in smaller and irregularly shaped nanoparticles and fragments (Figure 2a, Day 14). MPAES analysis corroborated these observations. With further degradation, the solution turned almost transparent from an initial milky white to completely transparent by day 21 (Figure S3c, Supporting Information). Only debris like silica fragments could be seen under the TEM (Figure 2a, Day 21) and almost complete breakdown resulted in 95.2 0.90% Si leaching into the solution, in the form of silicic acid (Figure 3 a).Figure 2In vitro selfdestruction of SNs.

All scale bars are 100 nm.Figure 3Systematic in vitro study. a) MPAES analysis of [Si] accumulated in SBF (at 37 C, pH 5). b) Cumulative release of SUN and BSA (in SBF at 37 C, pH 5). c) 89Zr labeling yields as a function of incubation time at 75 C, pH 78. d) Stability of 89Zr labeled SNs, in mouse serum at 37 C over 7 d (n = 3).To evaluate the influence of structure and pore size on degradability, two controls were used: solid or dense silica nanoparticles (dSNs; with no mesopores) and regular MSNs with a smaller pore size (23 nm). While bMSNs show a radially arranged porous network, dSNs have minimal porous structure and MSNs are composed of irregularly oriented mesochannels (Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information). As expected, both dSNs and MSNs showed much lower rates of degradation when compared to bMSNs. Even after 21 d of incubation in SBF, dSNs failed to show any appreciable change in morphology (Figure 2c, Day 21) or presence of Si ions in SBF (Figure 3a, orange line). MSNs displayed mild signs of degradation with somewhat distorted morphology and collapsed porous network after 21 d in SBF (Figure 2b, Day 21) and only 28% of the initial Si ion concentration was released at the end of the study period (Figure 3a, maroon line).The much more rapid degradation rate for bMSNs can be explained on the basis of their higher surface areas and lower degree of crosslinking of the silicate skeleton. The large pore size and hierarchically organized pores display a much larger surface area, as demonstrated earlier, which has been shown to enhance the degradation rate.18 In addition, Q 3/Q 4 ratio for dendritic bMSNs has been demonstrated to be 0.40.5,15 much smaller than that for MSNs19 and dSNs.20 The much lower degree of crosslinking between the silicate groups in bMSN may stem from the formation of dendritic porous channels resulting from the gentle condensation of silicates at the oilwater interface via the biphase stratification approach. In contrast rapid disorganized condensation of MSN porous network in the Stber process likely gives rise to a highly crosslinked silicate framework, which in turn may impede the degradation process. Further studies will be needed to study the degradation mechanism in detail. These results demonstrate that a hierarchical porous structure and larger pore diameter enhance the degradability of SNs by several folds, indicating the potential of bMSNs as a promising theranostic nanoplatform. Since, the physiological milieu is more complex, we believe that actual degradation of the nanoparticles should be more rapid in vivo, possibly aided by lysosomal enzymes. Ongoing studies aim to trace and improve upon the degradation process in vivo and decipher the exact mechanism. It is also worth mentioning that this time line of degradation of nanoparticles complements the purpose of drug delivery and imaging, where the nanocarrier is expected to degrade quickly enough to prevent any toxic reaction resulting from nonspecific accumulation, yet slow enough to prevent premature release of cargo during circulation. This is especially important for nanosystems with long blood circulation halflife. Hence, proper control over the degradation time and rate is essential for designing a clinically relevant nanovehicle. Extensive indepth studies are required in the future to carefully tailor the nanoparticle design and functionalization to develop an ideal, clinically translatable drug delivery vehicle.2.3Cargo Loading and ReleaseTumor cell heterogeneity and its implication for drug resistance have been the driving force for combination chemotherapy.21 MSNs with their high surface areatovolume ratios and easily tailorable chemistry provide an ideal platform to concurrently deliver multiple types of drugs to synergistically improve the efficacy of cancer therapeutics.10 Accordingly, to evaluate the effect of pore size and structure on cargo loading capacity, assynthesized SNs were suspended in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution of small molecule, hydrophobic antiangiogenesis drug (i.e., sunitinib malate [SUN]). Absence of a porous network resulted in minimal drug loading in dSNs, which showed only 8.4% loading efficiency. MSNs and bMSNs on the other hand, demonstrated high loading capacity, with up to 155.09 and 295.95 mg SUN loaded per g of nanoparticles, respectively (Table S2, Supporting Information). The large pore size of bMSNs provides an opportunity to load biomacromolecular therapeutics such as small proteins and even antibodies. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (molecular weight 66.5 kDa) was used as a model protein in this study to demonstrate the dual loading capacity of SNs. DLS measurements indicated the hydrodynamic size of BSA in PBS to be 8.63 nm; PDI 0.21. SUN loaded nanoparticles were suspended in a 2 mg mL1 PBS solution of BSA and gently mixed overnight. As expected, solid dSNs showed negligible encapsulation of the protein (1.5%). The effect of pore size on protein encapsulation was apparent. While small molecule drugs could be loaded at similar efficiency, distinct differences could be observed in protein loading capacities of the two types of porous nanostructures. 589.28 mg of BSA was encapsulated per g of bMSNs while only 250.0 mg could be loaded per g of MSN (Table S3, Supporting Information). Literature indicates that BSA assumes a prolate ellipsoidal structure hydrodynamically, with a longer and shorter axis.22 The lower but not zero loading of BSA into MSNs may result from wedging of the protein molecules into the smaller pore entrances through their shorter axes. The much larger hydrodynamic diameters compared to the small pore size (23 nm) of MSN rules out any real BSA loading inside the nanoparticles. SUN loading did not appreciably affect the loading of BSA, further attesting the efficacy of bMSNs to serve as nanocarriers for multiple cargo types and highlighting their potential for use in combination chemotherapy.The release of SUN and BSA from bMSNs and MSNs was then studied at 37 C in SBF (pH 5.0) to mimic the tumor microenvironment. Aliquots were drawn at regular time points and centrifuged to separate solid silica nanoparticles with entrapped SUN and BSA. The concentration of the released SUN and BSA was determined by measuring the UVvis absorption profiles of the supernatant at 460 and 280 nm, respectively. bMSNs and MSNs show distinctly different release profiles for both small molecule drug and larger protein (Figure 3b), which can be attributed to the differences in their mesostructures. MSNs with irregular mesoporous network of channels show an early burst release for both SUN and BSA within 10 h postincubation (42.74 2.98% and 59.22 5.54%, respectively). The quick release of SUN can be attributed to the diffusion of the drug loaded inside the MSN pores, climaxing at 56% cumulative release, upon reaching equilibrium. The rapid shedding of BSA was attributed to the dynamic nature of the in vitro experiment, since loosely wedged BSA molecules in the MSN pores could be easily freed in solution under shaking conditions. bMSNs, on the other hand, showed a multistage release for both SUN and BSA. Slow and steady release up to 24 h is followed by a sharp spike around day 3 (67.67 9.12% SUN and 83.31 6.89% BSA released) which coincides with accelerated fragmentation of bMSNs, indicating that degradability of bMSNs plays an important role in enhanced release of the loaded cargo. While traditional small pore MSNs rely only on equilibriumbased diffusion for release of the cargo, degradation of bMSNs provides greater opportunity for complete cargo release. Cumulative release of encapsulated drugs was found to be higher for bMSN (68.9 9.57% SUN and 93.13 7.67% BSA), when compared to MSN, further attesting the superiority of the degradable silica nanostructures. In addition to the enhanced release, the currently reported release profile is also better suited for longer circulating nanoparticles. A carefully tuned, slower release profile prevents premature shedding of cargo before the nanoconjugates have time to reach their target. Compared to the traditionally reported initialburstrelease behavior, a multistage release mechanism would potentially minimize offtarget toxicity. Moreover, the larger pores of bMSNs encapsulate larger amount of cargo and act as a protective support from the exogenous proteins and proteolytic attack in vivo, thereby enhancing the therapeutic index of the drugs multifold.2.4Intrinsic 89Zr Labeling of Silica NanoparticlesWe recently reported a novel application of mesoporous silica nanomaterials in intrinsic chelation of specific oxophilic radionuclides such as 89Zr.23 89Zr has an optimal halflife (t 1/2 = 78.4 h) and relatively low positron energy ( + avg = 395.5 keV), making it suitable for longterm in vivo tracking of nanoparticles, low uptake in the background tissue, and optimal dosimetry.24 For these reasons, 89Zr based radiopharmaceuticals are being actively translated to the clinic, with several clinical trials underway.25 The widely used protocol for 89Zr labeling involves a hexadentate chelator, desferrioxamine B (DFO). However, studies using DFO labeled tracers have still shown a significant bone uptake (after a week postinjection (p.i.)), indicative of the detached 89Zr, a wellknown osteophile.26, 27 Intrinsic labeling involving a carefully selected nanoplatform/radioisotope pair, can potentially overcome the problems associated with chelator instability and tedious chemistries for chelator functionalization.28 In the present study, silica nanoparticles were radiolabeled as described earlier.23 Briefly, SNs were incubated with 111 MBq of 89Zr (specific activity 20 GBq mol1) in 0.1 m HEPES (4(2hydroxyethyl)1piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer, pH 8 for 4 h at 75 C, with constant vigorous shaking. Rapid and highyield labeling was observed for all SNs. Comparable 89Zr labeling yields were observed for bMSNs (98.6%) and MSNs (95.8%) and slightly lower for dSNs (90.3%) (Figure 3c). However, serum stability tests are essential to assess the suitability of radiolabeled nanoparticles for in vivo applications. As evident from Figure 3d, majority of the 89Zr remained stably bound to bMSNs (95.60 0.01%) and MSNs (92.13 0.02%) up to 48 h postincubation in mouse serum. In comparison, 89Zr labeled dSNs showed much poorer stability, with only 52.84 0.03% 89Zr remaining stably chelated. High fidelity of the radiolabel to bMSNs can be attributed to the welldefined radial network of channels, which allows easy access to 89Zr ions into the interior recesses. Due to a large surface area, the core of the nanoparticle is expected to possess more neighboring deprotonated SiO groups which can stably chelate the oxophilic 89Zr, as compared to that on the surface. We believe that a much higher surface area of bMSN (741 m2 g1) stemming from hierarchically ordered large pore channels, compared to MSN (238 m2 g1),29 ensures the availability of greater number of deprotonated SiO groups available for more stable chelation of 89Zr. dSNs, on the other hand, possess little to no porous structure, keeping majority of the chelated 89Zr ions to the surface with fewer SiO groups. The coordination is expected to be weaker and hence 89Zr can easily dissociate from the parent dSNs over time. Encouraged by these results, 89 Zrlabeled bMSNs, were subsequently functionalized for in vivo studies.2.5Synthesis and Characterization of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105Prior to in vivo applications, assynthesized bMSNs were surface modified to impart optimal circulation time and tumor targeting capability, followed by systematic and thorough characterization. Scheme 1 depicts the major steps involved in the synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. bMSNs were first functionalized with amine groups (NH2) to aid in subsequent surface conjugations for in vivo studies. bMSNNH2 was then radiolabeled in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 8 for 2 h at 75 C. Presence of NH2 groups on bMSN did not appreciably affect the radiolabeling yield (94.7% within 2 h postincubation). The role of deprotonated silanol groups in 89Zr chelation was also confirmed by incubating bMSNNH2 in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, with the pH adjusted to 2. As expected, the radiolabeling yield was drastically reduced due to complete protonation of bMSNs under highly acidic conditions (Table S4, Supporting Information). Further, [89Zr]bMSNsNH2 was camouflaged with SCMPEG5kMal, in order to make them more bioactive and immune evasive for in vivo studies. Effective PEGylation is critical for longer circulation of nanoparticles and must be carefully tailored for each individual nanosystem. Succinimidyl carboxymethyl (SCM) is an NHS ester routinely used for PEGylation of primary amine bearing nanoparticles via amide linkage. However, it hydrolyzes rapidly in aqueous environments (0.75 min, pH 8). In the present study, twostep PEGylation was found to be more effective than a single step with same PEG amount and longer duration. The nanoconjugates demonstrated greater stability (at least two weeks in PBS) and longer circulation in vivo (data not shown).Scheme 1Schematic depiction of stepbystep synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. Uniform bMSNs (1) were modified with NH2 groups to form bMSNNH2 (2), followed by direct chelatorfree labeling with oxophilic 89Zr to form [89Zr]bMSNNH2 (3). Then (3) was PEGylated twice to yield [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kMal (4) which was subsequently conjugated with TRC105SH to obtain the final nanoconstructs, [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (5).Next, tumor targeting ability was conferred to the nanoconjugates by attachment of an antiCD105 antibody, i.e., TRC105, to the PEGylated samples. The antibody molecules were derivatized with thiol (SH) groups by reaction with Traut's reagent. About three thiol moieties per TRC105 were found to be optimal for nanoparticle conjugation. The conjugation of TRC105 to [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kMal was found to acutely depend on the reaction ratio, incubation time, and the number of reactive thiol groups on each antibody and had profound effect on in vivo biodistribution and targeting efficacy. Optimal results were obtained with the current protocol (details in the Experimental Section). Systematic calculations based on Bradford Assay, indicated that each bMSN has about 44 TRC105 molecules attached for an effective active targeting (Section S.3, Supporting Information). It is worth noting here that this number corroborates data from a previous report, where high (104 antibodies/nanoparticle) and low (15 antibodies/nanoparticle) ligand densities were shown to adversely affect the nanoparticlereceptor/antigen interactions due to crowding effects, and orientation and unfolding issues, respectively.30 Our ongoing studies aim to assess the effects of ligand density on in vivo nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting ability.Success of each step of the conjugation protocol was confirmed by the concurrently changing zeta potential values (Table S5, Supporting Information). Assynthesized bMSNs were negatively charged in PBS (48.37 0.31 mV) as expected due to deprotonated silanol groups at pH 2. [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 demonstrated a final zeta potential of 0.16 0.06 mV. This near neutral zeta potential of the nanoconjugates is advantageous since neutrally charged nanoparticles have been shown to circulate longer in the blood than their charged counterparts.31 2.6In Vivo Biodistribution and Tumor Vasculature Targeting with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105Angiogenesis plays a key role in tumor growth and metastasis and represents one of the most promising hallmarks for cancer diagnosis and treatment.32 CD105 or endoglin receptor, highly overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial cells and upregulated under hypoxic conditions, is a prime target for tumor imaging, prognosis, and antiangiogenic therapy in a variety of cancers including breast, colon, brain, and prostate.33 TRC105 (a human/murine chimeric IgG1) is a high avidity CD105targeted antibody, currently under multiple Phase II clinical trials.34 To assess the CD105 targeting of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, 2.8 1010 bMSN nanoconjugates were injected intravenously in 4T1 tumor bearing mice (14 mg kg1) and serial PET scans were performed 0.5, 6, 24, and 48 h p.i. Mice were randomized before injections and divided into three groups (n = 3 per group) designated as targeted, nontargeted, and blocking. Tumorbearing coronal slices are shown in Figure 4 . Regionofinterest (ROI) analysis was also performed and the timeactivity curves for the major sites of nanoparticle uptake can be seen in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).Figure 4In vivo tumor vasculature targeting. Representative tumorbearing coronal slices from serial PET scans. Targeted group: [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105; nontargeted group: [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k and blocking group: [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (with a preinjected blocking dose of TRC105). Yellow circles indicate the location of 4T1 breast tumor.Rapid and persistent uptake of nanoparticles was observed in the targeted group (4.5 0.6%ID g1) as soon as 0.5 h p.i., which increased to 11.4 2.1%ID g1, 6 h p.i., remaining constant thereafter up to 48 h p.i. (Figure 5 and Figure S5, Supporting Information). The control nontargeted and blocking groups injected with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (after a blocking dose 50 mg kg1 body weight; 6 h before injection), respectively, showed only minimal accumulation in the 4T1 tumors. Tumor uptake peaked at 3.6 0.3%ID g1 in the nontargeted group and 3.0 1.1%ID g1 in the blocking cohorts, indicating that CD105 targeting and not only enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, was responsible for the excellent and specific tumor uptake of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. Besides enhancement in absolute tumor uptake, [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 administration also resulted in greater tumor contrast and more rapid detection. Tumortomuscle (T/M) ratios, as high as 47.18 7.19 were obtained for the targeted group at 24 h p.i. (Figure 5 b and Table S6, Supporting Information). Not only T/M ratios, but also contrast index (CI) values were calculated to evaluate how well the tumor could be distinguished from normal tissues upon the introduction of targeted and nontargeted bMSNs (Figure 5c). Distinct enhancement in the CI values further demonstrated the advantage of CD105 targeting over passive targeting alone. Both [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k nanoconjugates demonstrated long circulation time with 1.2 0.3, 1.4 0.8, and 1.5 0.6%ID g1 remaining in the blood even after 24 h p.i. in the targeted, nontargeted, and blocking groups, respectively. Using a single bolus, twocompartment model, the elimination halflife (t 1/2) of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 was roughly evaluated to be 4.6 h (see Section S.4 and Figure S6, Supporting Information). Further studies are required for more accurate prediction of the distribution and elimination halflives of the intravenously injected nanoconjugates. The long residence time and enhanced tumor specific accumulation signify the promising potential of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 in cancer theranostics.Figure 5Quantitative regionofinterest (ROI) analysis and ex vivo biodistribution. Temporal variation of a) absolute tumor uptake, e) tumortomuscle ratio, and f) contrast index, for the targeted, nontargeted, and blocking groups. d) Ex vivo biodistribution data, 48 h p.i. (n = 3). The differences in tumor uptake between the targeted group and two control groups were statistically very significant (*P 0.05, **P 0.001, ***P 0.001).The uptake of the nanoconjugates in nontarget organs was confined to the RES organs, e.g., liver and spleen. Sequestration by the macrophages and phagocytes of the RES and eventual deposition in these organs is a common feature of intravenously injected nanoparticles, and was also observed in the present study. Importantly, the signal from the bone, indicative of detached 89Zr (89Zr is a wellknown osteophile35) remained low up to 48 h p.i. in all groups (1.3 0.6, 1.4 0.4, and 1.1 0.8%ID g1) and was much lower than that reported with DFO conjugated radiotracers.24 This finding further demonstrates the stability of intrinsic chelation of 89Zr by bMSNs. Interestingly, the signal from the joints increased at later time points (8%ID g1 in all groups) in accordance with the previous studies which show that 89Zr tends to preferentially accumulate in hypermineralized joints and epiphysis, likely due to chelation by hydroxylapatite, phosphates in the nonsoft ostium.35 At the terminal PET scans at 48 h p.i., mice from all three groups were euthanized and the harvested organs were analyzed by a welltype gammacounter detector. Ex vivo biodistribution data validated the PET ROI results and confirmed tumorspecific targeting with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 (Figure 5d).In addition, biodistribution of the nanoparticles was studied up to day 7. A steep rise in the osteal accumulation of 89Zr can be clearly observed from the maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in Figure S7 (Supporting Information) at day 3, which increase persistently with time. This behavior can be attributed possibly to the degradation of the bMSN skeleton (also consistent with the in vitro studies) and to the transmetalation of 89Zr present on the bMSN exterior (more loosely coordinated than that inside) by the intrinsic chelators or plasma proteins. Interestingly, the increase in radioactivity in the joints was accompanied by a concomitant decline in the %ID g1 values in the liver after day 3, likely due to the excretion of bMSNs and their fragments. Ongoing studies aim to fully explore the in vivo degradation and excretory behavior of bMSNs in complex physiological environments.To confirm the CD105 specific uptake of the nanoconjugates, a separate cohort of 4T1 tumorbearing mice was used in histological analyses. Amine modified bMSNs were tagged with a fluorescent dye, fluoresceinNHS ester (E x/E m: 495/518 nm) followed by PEGylation and TRC105 conjugation as described before. The injected mice were euthanized 6 h p.i. and tumor and other major organs were harvested and stained for CD31 (an endothelial marker). Muscle tissue was examined as a normal control. Enhanced fluorescence signal (green) from the nanoparticles can be clearly discerned in the targeted tumor tissue (Figure S8, Supporting Information), which overlapped with the signal from CD31 (red), indicating that the distribution was largely on the vasculature with minor extravasation. The nontargeted tumor tissue, on the other hand, displays a weak signal from the nanoparticles. Consistent with our PET studies, liver and spleen tissues show high accumulation of the nanoparticles; however, the uptake is largely nonspecific with no overlap with the CD31 marker. The muscle tissue, as expected, does not emit any fluorescence signal (consistent with our PET results).3ConclusionIn summary, we report the first systematic in vivo study of intrinsically 89Zrlabeled bMSNs, targeted for CD105 marker specificity in murine metastatic breast cancer model. The hierarchical, dendritic silica nanoparticles display centrally radiating mesopore channels with a twotiered morphology. Large, bimodal pore size (5.4 and 12 nm) distribution and the unique highly organized nanostructure of bMSNs were harnessed in this study to create a selfdestructible dualdrug carrier. Both degradation and protein release studies demonstrated a gradual and easily tunable trend which is better suited for longer circulating nanoparticles and minimizes any premature release of the cargo. Chelatorfree 89Zr labeling demonstrated excellent yields and in vivo stability with marginal 89Zr detachment and bone uptake. Careful tailoring of the synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 resulted in excellent CD105 specificity, which was confirmed by extensive in vivo and ex vivo testing. Vascular targeting exhibited greater than threefold enhancement in absolute tumor uptake and normal tissue contrast, when compared with EPR dependent uptake of the nanoconjugates.Considering the safety and easy tunability of silica nanoparticles, our simple and versatile approach to create selfdestructing angiogenesis targeted nanoplatforms can potentially pave the way for future personalized nanotheranostics. Through simple surface modifications, the nanoparticles can be tailored to (i) label a wide plethora of clinically relevant diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes (such as 45Ti (t 1/2 = 3.1 h), 177Lu (t 1/2 = 6.7 d), etc.) without the need for tiresome specific chelator chemistries, (ii) carry smallmolecule and large biomolecular drugs concurrently for combination therapy, (iii) specifically target multiple tumor types by modifying the targeting ligand, and (iv) selfdestruct to allow excretion from the body within a reasonable time period.4Experimental Section Materials: TRC105 was provided by TRACON Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA). NHS fluorescein, Chelex 100 resin (50100 mesh), TEOS, triethanolamine (TEA), (3aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APS), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride solution (CTAC, 25 wt%), cyclohexane, and BSA were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). AlexaFluor488 and Cy3labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, CA). PD10 columns were procured from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Absolute ethanol, sodium chloride (NaCl), and SUN were purchased from Fisher Scientific. SCMPEG5kMal was obtained from Creative PEGworks. Water and all buffers were of Millipore grade and pretreated with Chelex 100 resin to ensure that the aqueous solution was free of heavy metals. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Synthesis of Biodegradable Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: bMSNs with radially arranged mesochannels were synthesized using a biphase stratification method, reported previously, with slight modifications.15 For the synthesis of 160 nm sized bMSN with pore sizes of 5 and 12 nm, 24 mL CTAC, 180 mg TEA, and 36 mL water were stirred continuously at 60 C for 1 h. 1 mL TEOS in 19 mL cyclohexane solution (5 v/v%) was then added gently to the mixture and stirred (125 rpm) for 60 h. Asformed bMSNs in the aqueous layer were collected thereafter, by high speed centrifugation, followed by washing and removal of the CTAC template by immersion in 1 wt% NaClmethanol solution. The samples were washed repeatedly till all CTAC was removed. Synthesis of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: MSNs with a hydrodynamic size of 115 nm and pore size of 23 nm were synthesized as described previously.36 Briefly, 2 g CTAC and 20 mg TEA were stirred in 20 mL water for 1 h at room temperature. 1 mL TEOS was then added to the mixture and stirred in a water bath at 95 C for another 1 h. Assynthesized MSNs were collected by high speed centrifugation and subjected to NaClmethanol (1 wt%) treatment to remove the CTAC template. Synthesis of Dense Silica Nanoparticles: dSNs with a hydrodynamic diameter of 100 nm were synthesized using a modified Stber method.23 35.7 mL of absolute ethanol was mixed with 5 mL of water and 0.8 mL of ammonia and stirred for 10 min at room temperature. 1 mL TEOS was then added and the mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 1 h. dSNs were collected by centrifugation and washed with water/ethanol to remove the residual components. Characterization: TEM images were obtained on an FEI T12 microscope, operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. TEM samples were prepared on carbon coated copper grids following standard protocols. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Quantachrome Nova 4000e system. The samples were first calcined at 650 C for 12 h to ensure the removal of organic template. Surface area was determined using the BET method. Pore size distribution data were collected by the BJH method of the desorption branch of the isotherm. DLS and zeta potential analysis were performed on NanoZetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd.). Nanoparticle number was determined using NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Instruments Ltd.). Amine Modification of SNs: Amine groups were introduced onto silica nanoparticles to facilitate further surface conjugations. Assynthesized SNs were suspended in 20 mL absolute ethanol and reacted with APS (1 mL) at room temperature for 48 h. Thereafter, the sample was washed multiple times with ethanol to get rid of residual APS. Ninhydrin test was used to determine NH2 group concentration per mL of SNs. In Vitro Degradation in Simulated Body Fluid: SBF with ion concentration approximately equal to those of human blood plasma was prepared per the well documented recipe (Table S7, Supporting Information).37 pH was adjusted to 5.5 using HCl (1 m). In vitro degradation behaviors were studied by incubating equal amounts (3.5 mg) of all three types of SNs in 10 mL SBF solution (pH 5.5) with gentle stirring (350 rpm) at 37 C. Aliquots were drawn at regular intervals, replaced by equal amount of fresh SBF solution. The extracted solutions were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm. The pellet containing intact and fragmented nanoparticles was observed under the TEM. The supernatant was subjected to MPAES analysis (Agilent 4200 MPAES, CA) to determine the concentration of the released Si ions ([Si]tSupernatant).In addition, initial concentration of Si ions in the three SN samples ([Si]0SN) as well as basal Si concentration in the SBF solution ([Si]0SBF) were separately determined. Percentage Si accumulated in the SBF at each timepoint was determined as follows(1)[Si]tSBF=[Si]tSupernatant[Si]0SBF[Si]nSN100 Cargo Loading and Release Studies: Small molecule anticancer drug SUN and macromolecular protein BSA (66.5 kDa) were used as model therapeutic agents to demonstrate dual cargo encapsulation efficacy of SNs. SUN loading was carried out by dispersing equal amounts of SNs in a 2 mg mL1 solution of SUN in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 24 h with constant shaking, followed by centrifugation to remove any unencapsulated SUN. SUN concentration in the supernatant was determined based on the standard curve in DMSO at 460 nm. As prepared SN(SUN) samples were subsequently added to BSA solution (2 mg mL1 in PBS) and mixed gently for 24 h. Excess unloaded BSA was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was quantified at 280 nm using Nanodrop fluorospectrometer.Loading efficacy was defined as the ratio of guest molecule loaded in the nanoparticles to the total amount added (2)Loadingefficiency(%)=AmountofdrugloadedinSNsTotalamountofdrugadded100 Loading capacity defined as amount of drugs loaded per g of nanocarrier, was calculated using the following equation(3)Loadingcapacity(%)=AmountofdrugloadedinSNsAmountofSNs100 To carry out the release study, bMSN(SUNBSA) and MSN(SUNBSA) were suspended in SBF solution (pH 5.5) accompanied with gentle shaking. Aliquots were drawn periodically, centrifuged at high speed, and tested for released SUN and BSA using UVvis absorption at 460 and 280 nm, respectively. 89Zr Production: 89Zroxalate was produced according to previously reported procedures by the University of WisconsinMadison cyclotron group.38 Briefly, natural yttrium89 (89Y) foil (250 m, 99.9%) was irradiated with a proton beam to produce 89Zr via the 89Y(p,n)89Zr reaction by using a 16 MeV GE PETtrace cyclotron. After isotope separation and purification, 89Zroxalate was obtained, with a specific activity of 20 GBq mol1 of 89Zr. ChelatorFree 89Zr Labeling: 1 mL of asprepared aminated SNs in HEPES buffer (pH 7.5; 0.1 m) were mixed with 111 MBq 89Zr oxalate and the pH was adjusted to 89 using Na2CO3 solution (2 m). The mixture was incubated at 75 C for 4 h. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to quantify 89Zr labeling yields at different time points, using 0.05 m EDTA as the mobile phase. Final labeled products were collected by centrifugation. In Vitro Serum Stability: In vitro stability of the isotope was evaluated in serum by incubating 300 L of [89Zr]SN with 300 L of 2 whole mouse serum with constant shaking at 37 C for 7 d. At each timepoint, 100 L of the sample was withdrawn and purified by a 100 kDa centrifugal filter. Radioactivity in the filtrate and retentate were measured using a gamma counter and decayed back to day 0 for further calculations. Thiolation of TRC105: TRC105 antibody was thiolated to facilitate conjugation to bMSNs. 100 L of TRC105 (7 mg mL1) was mixed with Traut's reagent (2 mg mL1) in 1:30 molar ratio and reacted at room temperature for 1 h. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8, using 0.1 m Na2CO3. At the end of the incubation period, the mixture was purified on PD10 columns to get rid of residual Traut's reagent. The final concentration of TRC105SH was quantified using Nanodrop instrument. Ellman's reagent was used to quantify the number of SH moieties per antibody. Synthesis of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105: [89Zr]bMSNNH2 was further surface modified to make them suitable for in vivo targeted imaging. [89Zr]bMSNNH2 water solution (pH 67) was added to 2.5 mg (500 nmol) SCMPEG5kMal and reacted for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the excess PEG was removed by centrifugation. The PEGylation step was repeated under similar conditions. [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k was obtained after washing atleast twice with PBS and divided into two parts. Finally, 2.5 nmol of TRC105SH was added to onehalf of the above solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 was obtained as the final product and used for the targeted and blocking groups. The other half ([89Zr]bMSNPEG5k) was used as the nontargeted group. 4T1 Tumor Models: 4T1 breast cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with FBS and antibiotics). 2 106 cells, suspended in PBS were injected subcutaneously into the front flank of 45 weeks old Balb/c mice (Envigo, IN, USA) to establish the tumors. The animals were used for in vivo experiments once the tumor diameters reached 58 mm. In Vivo Vasculature Targeted PET Imaging: All animal studies were conducted per the protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 4T1 tumorbearing mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 3). 150 L (7.4 MBq) of either [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 or [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k was injected intravenously and serial PET scans were performed at various timepoints. The mice in the blocking group were each injected with unlabeled TRC105 antibody (dose: 5 mg kg1), 6 h before [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 administration.Serial PET scans (at 0.5, 6, 24, and 48 h p.i.) were performed using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.). Image acquisition, reconstruction, and ROI analysis were performed as described previously.38 All PET data were decay corrected to the initial timepoint and is presented as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID g1). Contrast enhancement was calculated in terms of two parameters: Tumortomuscle ratio (4)(T/M)=BqmL1intumorBqmL1inmuscle (5)Contrastindex(CI)=BqmL1(tumor)BqmL1(muscle)BqmL1(contralateralregion)BqmL1(muscle) (Same volume ROIs were drawn on tumor and contralateral regions on the same plane/frame in the tomographic dataset.) Ex Vivo Biodistribution: Ex vivo biodistribution studies were carried out after the final PET scans at 48 h p.i. to ensure that the quantitative uptake from the PET ROI values truly represented the radioactivity distribution in 4T1 tumorbearing mice. The mice were euthanized and all the major tissues were harvested and wet weighted. The radioactivity measurements for each tissue were carried out using a gamma counter (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA) and presented as %ID g1. Histology: To carry out histological analysis of the major tissues, fluoresceinNHS dye conjugated bMSNs (FITCbMSNPEG5kTRC105 and FITCbMSNPEG5k) were injected intravenously in 4T1 tumorbearing mice. The tissues were harvested at 6 h p.i. and fixed in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) formulation prior to sectioning. Frozen tissue slices of 6 m were fixed with cold acetone and stained for endothelial marker CD31, as described previously through the use of a rat antimouse CD31 antibody and a Cy3labeled donkey antirat IgG.39 All images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope.Supporting informationAs a service to our authors and readers, this journal provides supporting information supplied by the authors.

      "The article presents a study on the behavior of biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) designed to carry multiple cargos and self-destruct following the release of their payloads. The bMSNs are intrinsically radiolabeled with oxophilic zirconium89 (89Zr) radionuclide to track their in vivo pharmacokinetics via positron emission tomography imaging. The study successfully demonstrates rapid and persistent CD105 specific tumor vasculature targeting in a murine model of metastatic breast cancer using TRC105 (an antiCD105 antibody). Complete degradation of bMSNs is seen within 21 days of incubation in simulated body fluid.The article discusses the use of biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) for nanomedicine. The study focuses on the intrinsic radiolabeling and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the nanoparticles for in vivo biodistribution and tumor targeting studies. The article highlights the challenges facing nanomedicine and the need for safe and nonimmunogenic nanoparticles that can effectively deliver therapy and be cleared from the body. The study presents a simple and versatile approach to overcome these challenges and further the goals of personalized nanotheranostics.The article discusses the need for nanocarriers for biomacromolecular drugs in cancer therapeutics. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are a promising option due to their large specific surface area and well-defined porous structure. However, their inefficient tumor targeting and rapid sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) have limited their clinical applications. The article proposes an improved design for silica nanoconjugates that can entrap large molecular drugs, self-destruct into small fragments, and facilitate clearance.Dendritic, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) were synthesized with a centrally radiating, two-tiered porous network. The nanoparticles were designed to (1) load macromolecular cargo, (2) degrade over time, (3) accumulate in tumor tissues, and (4) be tracked over a long period of time using intrinsically labeled zirconium89 (89Zr) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The bMSNs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The nanoparticles were found to be monodispersed, with a diameter of 162.9 nm, and a concentration of 8.97 x 10^11 nanoparticles/mL or 3.59 x 10^14 g^-1.The article describes the physicochemical characterization of bMSNs, including their size, surface area, and pore size distribution. The concentration of silanol groups was estimated to be 1 107 per nanoparticle. The article also mentions a simplified one-pot synthetic protocol for tailoring the pore size of bMSNs. The degradation study of silica nanoparticles is briefly mentioned but not elaborated on.The biodistribution of nanoparticles larger than 10 nm is challenging due to their prolonged residence in non-targeted organs. Self-destructing silica nanoparticles can be a promising platform for in vivo imaging and drug delivery. The degradation of as-synthesized nanoparticles was tested by incubating them in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37°C for 21 days with constant stirring. The pH of the soaking solution was tuned to 4.5 to mimic the natural lysosomal environment. The degradation accelerated over time, resulting in smaller and irregularly shaped nanoparticles and fragments. Only debris like silica fragments could be seen under the TEM by day 21.The article discusses the biodistribution of silica nanoparticles (SNs) with different structures and pore sizes. The study found that SNs with a radially arranged porous network (bMSNs) had a higher degradation rate compared to solid or dense silica nanoparticles (dSNs) and regular mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a smaller pore size. The higher surface area and lower degree of crosslinking of the silicate skeleton in bMSNs were attributed to the faster degradation rate. The study also analyzed the release of Si ions and labeled SNs in mouse serum.The article discusses the degradation of silica nanoparticles (SNs) and how their hierarchical porous structure and larger pore diameter enhance their degradability. The degradation process is expected to be more rapid in vivo, aided by lysosomal enzymes. The article also mentions the importance of controlling the degradation time and rate for designing a clinically relevant nanovehicle. The article further discusses the potential of MSNs as a promising theranostic nanoplatform for drug delivery and imaging. The high surface area-to-volume ratio and easily tailorable chemistry of MSNs make them an ideal platform for combination chemotherapy.The study evaluated the effect of pore size and structure on cargo loading capacity of synthesized SNs. The loading capacity of small molecule, hydrophobic antiangiogenesis drug (SUN) was tested in SNs suspended in a DMSO solution. MSNs and bMSNs demonstrated high loading capacity, with up to 155.09 and 295.95 mg SUN loaded per g of nanoparticles, respectively. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein to demonstrate the dual loading capacity of SNs. The effect of pore size on protein encapsulation was apparent, with 589.28 mg of BSA encapsulated per g of bMSNs while only 250.0 mg could be loaded per g of MSN.The study investigated the release of small molecule drug (SUN) and larger protein (BSA) from bMSNs and MSNs at 37°C in SBF (pH 5.0) to mimic the tumor microenvironment. The release profiles of SUN and BSA from bMSNs and MSNs were different due to the differences in their mesostructures. bMSNs showed a multistage release for both SUN and BSA, with slow and steady release up to 24 h followed by a sharp spike around day 3. The degradability of bMSNs played an important role in enhanced release of the loaded cargo. Cumulative release of encapsulated drugs was found to be higher for bMSN than MSN.The article discusses the use of degradable silica nanostructures for drug delivery. The nanostructures have a slower release profile, which prevents premature shedding of cargo and minimizes off-target toxicity. The larger pores of the nanostructures also encapsulate a larger amount of cargo and protect it from exogenous proteins and proteolytic attack in vivo, enhancing the therapeutic index of the drugs. The article also describes a novel application of mesoporous silica nanomaterials in intrinsic chelation of specific oxophilic radionuclides such as 89Zr, which can potentially overcome the problems associated with chelator instability and tedious chemistries for chelator functionalization.The article discusses the labeling and stability of three types of silica nanoparticles (bMSNs, MSNs, and dSNs) with 89Zr for in vivo applications. The bMSNs and MSNs showed high labeling yields and stability in serum, while dSNs showed poorer stability. The high surface area of bMSNs is believed to contribute to their stability. The bMSNs were subsequently functionalized for in vivo studies.The article describes the synthesis of a nanomaterial, [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, for in vivo studies. The nanomaterial was synthesized through a step-by-step process involving modification with NH2 groups, radiolabeling with 89Zr, and PEGylation. The nanomaterial was then conjugated with an anti-CD105 antibody for tumor targeting. The PEGylation process was found to be more effective with a two-step process. The article also discusses the importance of effective PEGylation for longer circulation of nanoparticles.The article discusses the conjugation of TRC105 to [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kMal and its effect on in vivo biodistribution and targeting efficacy. The optimal protocol was found to depend on the reaction ratio, incubation time, and the number of reactive thiol groups on each antibody. The number of TRC105 molecules attached to each bMSN was calculated to be about 44 for effective active targeting. The ligand density was shown to affect nanoparticle-receptor/antigen interactions. The zeta potential values confirmed the success of each step of the conjugation protocol. The near-neutral zeta potential of the nanoconjugates is advantageous for longer circulation in the blood. The article also discusses in vivo biodistribution and tumor vasculature targeting with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, which targets the CD105 or endoglin receptor highly overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial cells.The study aimed to assess the CD105 targeting of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, a nanoconjugate, in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Rapid and persistent uptake of nanoparticles was observed in the targeted group, while the control nontargeted and blocking groups showed only minimal accumulation in the tumors. CD105 targeting was responsible for the excellent and specific tumor uptake of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. The administration of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 resulted in greater tumor contrast and more rapid detection.The study evaluated the biodistribution of targeted and non-targeted bMSNs in mice using quantitative region-of-interest analysis and ex vivo biodistribution. The results showed enhanced tumor-specific accumulation and long circulation time of the targeted bMSNs. The uptake of the nanoconjugates in non-target organs was confined to the RES organs, and the elimination half-life of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 was roughly evaluated to be 4.6 h. Further studies are required for more accurate prediction of the distribution and elimination half-lives of the intravenously injected nanoconjugates.The biodistribution of bMSNs was studied in mice using PET scans and ex vivo analysis up to day 7. The signal from the joints increased at later time points, likely due to chelation by hydroxylapatite. The osteal accumulation of 89Zr increased persistently with time, possibly due to the degradation of the bMSN skeleton and transmetalation of 89Zr by intrinsic chelators or plasma proteins. The increase in radioactivity in the joints was accompanied by a decline in the %ID g1 values in the liver after day 3, likely due to the excretion of bMSNs and their fragments. CD105 specific uptake of the nanoconjugates was confirmed through histological analyses.The study reports the first systematic in vivo study of intrinsically 89Zr-labeled bMSNs, targeted for CD105 marker specificity in murine metastatic breast cancer model. The nanoparticles were found to be largely distributed on the vasculature with minor extravasation. The liver and spleen tissues show high accumulation of the nanoparticles, but the uptake is largely nonspecific. The muscle tissue does not emit any fluorescence signal. The study demonstrates excellent CD105 specificity, which was confirmed by extensive in vivo and ex vivo testing. Vascular targeting exhibited greater than threefold enhancement in absolute tumor uptake and normal tissue contrast.The article discusses a method to create self-destructing angiogenesis targeted nanoplatforms using silica nanoparticles. The nanoparticles can be modified to label diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes, carry small and large biomolecular drugs, target multiple tumor types, and self-destruct for excretion from the body. The experiment involved synthesizing biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles with radially arranged mesochannels using a biphase stratification method. The materials used included TRC105, NHS fluorescein, Chelex 100 resin, TEOS, triethanolamine, APS, CTAC, cyclohexane, BSA, AlexaFluor488, Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies, PD10 columns, absolute ethanol, sodium chloride, SUN, and SCMPEG5kMal.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of three types of silica nanoparticles: bMSNs, MSNs, and dSNs. The bMSNs were synthesized by mixing CTAC, TEA, and TEOS in water, followed by centrifugation and removal of the CTAC template. The MSNs were synthesized by mixing CTAC, TEA, and TEOS in water, followed by centrifugation and removal of the CTAC template. The dSNs were synthesized using a modified Stber method. The nanoparticles were characterized using TEM, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, DLS, and zeta potential analysis.Silica nanoparticles were modified with amine groups to facilitate surface conjugations. In vitro degradation behaviors were studied by incubating equal amounts of all three types of silica nanoparticles in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The concentration of released Si ions was determined using MPAES analysis. Small molecule anticancer drug SUN and macromolecular protein BSA were used as model therapeutic agents to demonstrate dual cargo encapsulation efficacy of silica nanoparticles. SUN loading was carried out by dispersing equal amounts of silica nanoparticles in a 2 mg/mL solution of SUN in DMSO.The article describes a study on the biodistribution of nanomaterials. The loading efficacy and capacity of the nanomaterials were determined by adding them to a BSA solution and quantifying the supernatant. The release study was carried out by suspending the nanomaterials in a solution and periodically testing for released substances. The nanomaterials were labeled with 89Zr using chelator-free labeling and their in vitro serum stability was evaluated. The specific procedures and parameters used in the experiment are detailed.The study involved the synthesis of a targeted imaging agent using thiolated TRC105 antibody conjugated to bMSNs. The biodistribution of the agent was studied in 4T1 breast cancer cells in Balb/c mice using in vivo vasculature targeted PET imaging. The agent was purified using a 100 kDa centrifugal filter, and radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter. The study was conducted per the approved protocol of the University.The biodistribution of two types of nanomaterials ([89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k) was studied in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. PET scans were performed at various timepoints, and ex vivo biodistribution studies were carried out after the final PET scans at 48 h p.i. Histological analysis of major tissues was also conducted. The contrast enhancement was calculated in terms of two parameters: Tumor-to-muscle ratio and contrast index. The mice in the blocking group were each injected with unlabeled TRC105 antibody (dose: 5 mg kg1), 6 h before [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 administration.The article discusses the use of a rat antimouse CD31 antibody and a Cy3-labeled donkey antirat IgG to study the biodistribution of nanomaterials in rats. The images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. The work was supported by various organizations including the National Institutes of Health and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The article also includes references to other studies on nanomedicine. Supplementary data files are available.The article cites various studies on the biodistribution of silica nanoparticles, including their use in PET imaging for melanoma and brain tumors, as well as sentinel lymph node mapping in head and neck melanoma, breast, and cervical/uterine cancer patients. The safety of silicon dioxide in human food is also mentioned. The article references studies on the toxicity and properties of silica nanoparticles, as well as their potential use in cancer imaging and treatment.The biodistribution of nanomaterials was studied in various scientific articles. The experiments were conducted using different types of nanomaterials and imaging techniques. The articles were published in various scientific journals between 2003 and 2014.\n"

      "The article describes the development of anisotropic, branched, gold nanoarchitectures (Au-tripods) for bioimaging. The Au-tripods were less than 20 nm in size and were identified as high-absorbance nanomaterials for in vivo photoacoustic imaging (PAI). The in vivo biodistribution of Au-tripods was confirmed using small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Intravenous administration of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Cys (RGDfC) peptide conjugated Au-tripods (RGD-Au-tripods) to U87MG tumor-bearing mice showed PAI contrasts in tumors almost 3-fold higher than for the blocking group. Quantitative biodistribution data revealed that 7.The study synthesized Au-tripods through controlled chemical synthesis and found that .9% ID/g of RGD-Au-tripods accumulated in U87MG tumors after 24 hours post-injection. A pilot mouse toxicology study showed no significant acute or systemic toxicity. The study suggests that Au-tripods could serve as a new platform for multimodality molecular imaging. The article discusses the potential of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and various light-absorbing nanoparticles for contrast enhancement in PAI, but notes that their potential toxicity is still under investigation.The article discusses the use of gold-based nanomaterials for biomedical applications. The authors developed a synthetic strategy to construct anisotropic nanomultipods with improved yield and quality. The nanomultipods have various shapes, including dipods, tripods, and tetrapods. The authors aim to improve the targeting efficiency and control the pharmacokinetics and biodistributions of the nanomaterials through variations in size, shape, and surface properties. The article highlights the challenges in precise control of the geometries and monodispersity of metallic nanostructures with complex shapes.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of gold tripods (Au tripods) with well-defined absorptions in visible and NIR regions. The authors conjugated v3 integrins targeting peptide to PEGylated Au-tripods and used them as a PAI contrast agent to image tumor angiogenesis. The tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo profile of PEGylated Au-tripods labeled with radionuclide 64Cu were evaluated in a subcutaneous v3-positive U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model using small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Finally, PAI was performed to investigate the targeting and imaging performance of RGD-Au-tripods as photoacoustic contrast agents. The article also includes a schematic showing the stepwise syntheses of various gold multipods via a set of known nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes.The article describes the synthesis of monodisperse Pt nanocubes using stepwise seed-mediated growth processes. The Pt nanocubes are used as seeds for the epitaxial growth of gold, resulting in the formation of various Au heterostructures, including dumbbell-like AuPt NPs, Au-dipods, and Au-tripods. The Au-tripods have two geometrical isomers, one with C3v symmetry and the other with C2v symmetry. The spatial distribution of Au crystals on the Pt nanocubes is determined by steric accessibility. This is the first time novel Au tripods have been constructed with high yield and improved quality using known nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes.The article discusses the synthesis and characterization of branched gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with anisotropic nanostructures and surface roughness. The study identifies two types of tripods, tripod-T and tripod-A, with slightly more tripod-T obtained. The sizes and shapes of various Au-multipods and each component within NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM. The representative TEM and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images of Au-tripods showed that well-crystallized interfaces were formed between the Pt seeds and grown Au branches.The article discusses the spatial configuration of Au branches and Pt core within Au-tripods using HRTEM and STEM images. The study confirms the spatial distribution of Pt and Au in tripods using forward and inverse fast Fourier transform. The article also discusses the optical properties of Au-tripods and their absorption cross-section.The article discusses the optical properties of gold nanomaterials, specifically Au-tripods, and their biodistribution. The study used UVvisNIR spectrometer and photoacoustic measurements to calculate the absorption coefficient of Au-tripods. The results showed two plasmon resonances at 540 and 700 nm peaks. The 540 nm feature corresponds to a quadrupole resonance out of the plane of the gold tripods, and the 700 nm feature is attributed to a dipole resonance in the plane of the Au-tripods. The article also includes figures showing the calculated absorption cross section of tripod-T and tripod-A as a function of x.The article discusses the use of gold multipods for photoacoustic imaging. The authors used methylene blue as a reference dye to obtain a calibration curve and calculated the absorption coefficient of the gold multipods. They found that the Au-tripods generate more contrast on PA images within the NIR region compared to gold rods. The authors also performed numerical analysis on various gold multipods using a commercial finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation package to gain more insight into the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra and to obtain better structural optimization.The article discusses the polarization-dependent cross section of Au-tripods and their maximum field enhancement regions. The electric fields on the surface of Au-tripods are significantly higher than those around spherical gold nanoparticles. The article also describes a PEGylation strategy to stabilize the Au-tripods in aqueous solution and reduce their accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system. The strategy involves the formation of goldthiolate bonds and subsequent immobilization of various biological molecules via bioconjugation chemistry. The article further explains the conjugation of c(RGDfC) and 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) to the surface of RGD-Au-tripods for 64Cu radiolabeling.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of RGD-Au-tripods, which were found to be stable and biocompatible in small living subjects. The pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor-targeting ability of Au-tripods were investigated in small living animals. The water-soluble Au-tripods were coated with a layer of functional PEG chains, and the chelating agent NOTA was attached to the terminal of PEG chains for PET radionuclide 64Cu. The 64Cu radiolabels on the tripods remained intact on the tripods even though they were incubated in the mouse serum over 2.The biodistribution of PEGylated tripods was studied in U87MG tumor-bearing mice using small animal PET scans at different time points (1, 2, 4, 24, and 48 h) after tail-vein injection of 64CuAu-tripod. The results showed nonspecific uptake of tripods by the liver, spleen, and kidney, with minimum accumulation in muscle or other major organs. The renal excretion was suggested as an additional clearance route for tripods. The PEGylated tripods showed slow systemic clearance due to a long blood circulation time (t1/2 = 2.29 h), making them more available for distribution to target tissues via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.The study aimed to target integrin v3 for imaging tumor angiogenesis and metastasis using RGD-Au-tripods. The targeting ability and specificity of RGD-Au-tripods for the v3 integrin were evaluated in the U87MG tumor-bearing mice. The results showed that tumor uptake of 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods gradually accumulated in the tumor between 1 and 24 h, reaching a plateau at about 24 h post-injection, and then leveled off in the next 24 h. The 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods exhibited a significantly high tumor uptake of 7.9% ID/g after 24 h post-injection, which was more than 3 times higher than that of plain 64CuAu-tripods (2.6% ID/g).The article discusses the biodistribution of D-Au-tripods and 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripods in mice, with the latter showing less uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and being excreted through both hepatobiliary and renal routes. The article also describes the use of RGD-Au-tripods for photoacoustic molecular imaging, with a linear correlation observed between the number of tumor cells loaded with RGD-Au-tripods and the corresponding photoacoustic signal. The minimum detectable number of tumor cells exposed to RGD-Au-tripods was found to be 11.5 103.The study evaluated the photoacoustic imaging (PAI) sensitivity of RGD-Au-tripods in living mice. The right hind side of a mouse was subcutaneously injected with RGD-Au-tripods mixed with Matrigel at increasing concentrations. The photoacoustic signals showed the tripods contrast in the mice, and a linear correlation was found between the tripod concentration and the corresponding photoacoustic signal. The PAI imaging ability of RGD-Au-tripods to v3 integrin-positive tumor was also evaluated in U87MG tumor-bearing mice.The study used photoacoustic imaging to track the biodistribution of RGD-Au-tripods in U87MG tumor-bearing mice. The mice were injected with 100-200 L of RGD-Au-tripods and photoacoustic images were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours post-injection. The results showed that the RGD-Au-tripods accumulated in the tumor between 1 and 4 hours, reaching a plateau at about 2 hours post-injection. The mice injected with RGD-Au-tripods at 2 hours post-injection showed more than 3 times higher photoacoustic signal in the tumor than the mice coinjected with RGD and RGD-Au-tripods. The study confirmed the specific targeting ability of RGD-Au-tripods toward U87MG tumors.The biodistribution of RGD-Au-tripod was studied in nude mice bearing U87MG tumors. Photoacoustic and ultrasound images were obtained before injection and at 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours after intravenous injection of RGD-Au-tripod. Coinjection of a blocking dose of c(RGDfC) and RGD-Au-tripod was also performed. Mice injected with RGD-Au-tripod showed significantly higher photoacoustic signal than mice with coinjection of a blocking dose of c(RGDfC) and the same amount of RGD-Au-tripod. The study showed the ability to engineer and manipulate constitutional nanocrystals at the nanometer-scale to build novel nanotripods in a predictable and controlled manner.The article discusses the formation of uniform Au-tripods using 6.5 nm cubic seeds and known nucleation reactions and epitaxial growth processes. The resulting anisotropic tripod nanostructures were used to design and fabricate PAI nanoprobes. The Au-tripods exhibit superior optical properties in the NIR region and have exceptionally small sizes, making them ideal for in vivo molecular imaging. The in vivo biodistribution of Au-tripods was confirmed by 64Cu radiolabeling and imaging their localization over time using PET. The Au-tripods accumulated in the liver and spleen after intravenous administration.The study investigated the biodistribution of anisotropic Au-tripods in mice. The hepatic excretion was found to be a major route of elimination, while renal excretion was also observed due to the shape of the particles. The Au-tripods showed high tumor uptake and low liver and spleen accumulation, likely due to their unique shape and size. The study also developed a control and stepwise strategy to build novel anisotropic Au-tripods with superior properties. No significant acute and systemic toxicity was observed in a pilot mouse toxicology study.The article discusses the use of Au-tripods as contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in cancer detection. The functionalized RGD-tripods showed enhanced contrast effect in both phantom and small animal imaging experiments. The Au-tripods have excellent biocompatibility and stability in a biological environment, ease of functionalization, passive and activated targeting capabilities, and potential hepatic and renal clearance. The size of various cubic Pt NPs was successfully tuned by adjustment of the reaction conditions in a precise manner. Materials used in the experiment include integrin v3 targeting peptide, hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate, platinum(II) acetylacetonate, and various chemicals and solvents.Platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) were synthesized by thermal decomposition of platinum precursor in 1-octadecene solution containing a trace amount of iron pentacarbonyl. Multiple stepwise seed-mediated growth processes were applied to obtain monodisperse Pt nanocubes. Gold branched nanostructures were formed by injecting freshly synthesized Pt NPs into a solution of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate in 1-octadecene. The Au-tripods were then surface PEGylated using bidentate thiol-terminated PEG chains.PEGylated Au-tripods were synthesized and characterized using various techniques. The conjugation of Au-tripods with cRGD was achieved by incubating the cross-linker solution with the water-soluble Au-tripods in PBS for 2 hours. The resultant thiol-active Au-tripods were then incubated with the cRGDfC stock solution for 24 hours. The final product, RGD-Au-tripods, was concentrated and stored at 4°C. The biodistribution of these nanoparticles was not discussed in this excerpt.The article describes the synthesis and biodistribution of RGD-Au-tripods in small animals. The tripods were conjugated with RGD and NOTA, and their gold and platinum concentrations were measured. PET imaging was performed at various time points after injection of 64Cu-RGD-Au-tripod in U87MG tumor-bearing mice. The study evaluated differences in specific targeting and biodistribution of Au-tripods and RGD modified tripods. Prior to imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane.The study used PET and photoacoustic imaging to investigate the biodistribution of Au-tripod-RGD in living mice with U87MG tumors. Two groups of female nude mice were inoculated with U87MG cells and allowed to grow tumors. The mice were then injected with RGD-Au-tripods and imaged using photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging at various time points. The study also included a receptor-blocking experiment. The results were analyzed using AsiPro and Amide image processing software.The biodistribution of gold nanorods (GNRs) was studied in mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts. The GNRs were functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and RGD peptide to improve their biocompatibility and targeting efficiency, respectively. The mice were imaged using photoacoustic tomography (PAT) at different time points after intravenous injection of the GNRs. The GNRs were found to accumulate in the tumor and liver, with minimal accumulation in other organs. The GNRs were further characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental analysis.The article cites various studies on the biodistribution of nanomaterials, including gold nanoparticles, in different animal models and cell cultures.

      "The article discusses the use of radioactive 198Au-doped nanostructures for in vivo analysis of their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution. The study focuses on comparing the biodistribution of different shapes of Au nanostructures, including nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages, using a murine EMT6 breast cancer model. The radioactive Au nanostructures were injected into a tumor-bearing mouse intravenously after PEGylation. The article highlights the potential of incorporating radioactive 198Au into the crystal lattice of Au nanostructures for simple and reliable quantification of their in vivo biodistribution and optical imaging by detecting the Cerenkov radiation.The article discusses the importance of Au-based nanostructures for cancer theranostics, including imaging, drug delivery, and therapy. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties of these nanostructures can be tuned for optical imaging and photothermal destruction of tumors. The LSPR can be tuned into the transparent window of soft tissues in the near-infrared (NIR) region for in vivo application. Additionally, Au nanostructures can be functionalized with radioactive species for PET imaging, Cerenkov imaging, and/or radiotherapy. The biodistribution and tumor uptake of radioactive gold nanostructures with different shapes (nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages) were studied using Cerenkov imaging and autoradiographic imaging. The results showed shape dependence in the intratumoral distribution of the nanostructures.The article discusses the biodistribution of Au nanostructures for cancer theranostics. The nanostructures must enter and distribute evenly throughout the tumor, which is composed of heterogeneous microenvironments. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect allows nanostructures to enter the tumor by leaking out through the gaps between endothelial cells of the chaotic and hyperpermeable vasculature of a tumor. The size and shape of the nanostructures affect their efficacy in tumor accumulation and subsequent clearance. Nanostructures with other shapes (e.g., nanorods) can have distinct EPR effects due to alterations to their in vivo hydrodynamic behaviors. The effect of shape on the EPR effect and thus tumor uptake still needs further assessment. The influence of size or shape of nanostructures on their in vivo intratumoral distribution is yet to be explored despite its paramount importance in cancer diagnosis and therapy.The study aimed to evaluate the effects of different shapes of gold nanostructures on their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution. Radioactive 198Au was incorporated into four different shapes of gold nanostructures, including nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages. The biodistribution was analyzed quantitatively using the characteristic emission from 198Au, while Cerenkov luminescence was used for monitoring tumor uptake in vivo and autoradiography imaging of intratumoral distribution ex vivo. The study also employed photoacoustic (PA) imaging, PET imaging, and histological staining to characterize tumor vascularity, hypoxia, metabolism, and spatial heterogeneity. The results showed that the shape of gold nanostructures played a critical role in determining their biodistribution, tumor uptake, and intratumoral distribution in a murine EMT6 breast cancer model.The article discusses the biodistribution of four different shapes of Au nanostructures (nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages) and their tumor targeting efficacy. The study used radiation from 198Au for quantitative analyses of biodistribution and tumor targeting efficacy, and visible light generated from emission for in vivo Cerenkov imaging. The radionuclide was incorporated into the crystal lattice of the nanostructures, allowing for accurate in vivo analysis without worrying about potential issues associated with the linker. The nanostructures were synthesized with a similar size of around 50 nm, and their LSPR peaks were located at different wavelengths. The study suggests that these nanostructures have potential as in vivo theranostic agents.The article describes the preparation and biodistribution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated gold (Au) nanostructures with four different shapes (nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and cubic nanocages) in mice bearing EMT6 tumors. The specific radioactivity of the Au nanostructures was controlled by varying the ratio of radioactive H198AuCl4 to nonradioactive HAuCl4. The biodistribution of the PEGylated, 198Au-incorporated Au nanostructures was analyzed by tracing the radiation from 198Au. All the samples of Au nanostructures showed high hepatic and splenic accumulation, but the PEGylated Au nanospheres circulated in the bloodstream significantly longer than the other three types of nanostructures.The article discusses the biodistribution of four types of gold nanostructures (nanospheres, nanorods, nanodisks, and nanocages) in mice. The nanospheres showed the least clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) and accumulated the least in the liver and spleen. The nanocages had the best blood circulation and showed the least decrease in blood retention during the first 6 hours. The nanorods had the worst blood circulation and showed the highest clearance by the MPS. All types of nanostructures showed significant accumulation in the liver at 1 hour post-injection. No significant clearance was observed for any of the nanostructures in urine or feces at 24 hours post-injection.The biodistribution of different shapes of PEGylated Au nanomaterials was studied in mice bearing EMT6 tumors. Nanospheres showed the highest accumulation in tumors, increasing from 2.1% ID/g at 1 h to 23.2% ID/g at 24 h. Nanodisks showed a surge in accumulation up to 6 h, with 4.4% ID/g at 6 h. Nanorods did not efficiently accumulate in tumors, with less than 2.0% ID/g even at 24 h postinjection. Nanocages accumulated in tumors throughout the 24 h period, increasing from 1.2% ID/g at 1 h to 7.5% ID/g at 24 h postinjection. Luminescence imaging showed accumulation of all the Au nanostructures in tumors and in areas corresponding to liver and spleen.The article discusses the biodistribution and intratumoral distribution of different types of gold nanostructures in tumor-bearing mice. The luminescence signals were mainly detected from the liver, spleen, and tumor for all four types of nanostructures. The nanospheres and nanodisks showed stronger luminescence in the tumor region compared to nanorods and nanocages. Autoradiography imaging showed that signals associated with the nanostructures were only detected in the periphery of the tumors for both nanospheres and nanodisks. The study did not observe any adverse effects with the administration of the nanostructures at a lower dose.The article discusses the biodistribution of different types of gold nanoparticles in mice with tumors. The study found that nanospheres and nanodisks showed stronger luminescence than nanorods and nanocages, which may be due to the attenuation of Cerenkov radiation. The accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors is explained by the EPR effect, which is closely related to tumor vasculature. The study used PA imaging to characterize the vasculature in the tumor. The article suggests that further studies comparing the intratumoral distributions of nanoparticles with different sizes will lead to the identification of nanostructures with optimal size and shapes for cancer imaging and therapy.The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution of nanomaterials in EMT6 tumor models. Photoacoustic imaging was used to visualize the vasculature inside and surrounding the tumor. The tumor blood volume was found to be 2.3 times greater than other tissues, indicating the potential for nanostructures to transport into the tumor. Histological staining and PET imaging were used to further characterize the vascularity and hypoxic regions of the tumor. The vasculature and microenvironment were found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the tumor.The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution of nanostructures in tumors for diagnosis and photothermal therapy. The experiment was conducted on EMT6 tumor models in mice. The study used PA imaging, histology staining, and PET imaging to confirm the presence of intratumoral vasculature, heterogeneous microenvironments, and high glucose metabolism. The results showed that nanostructures can enter the tumor through the vasculature and accumulate in the tumor due to the EPR effect. The transport of nanostructures is controlled by diffusion through hypoxic microenvironments. Smaller nanostructures diffuse deeper into tumors compared to larger ones. All four colloidal samples of Au nanostructures showed good stability when incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate buffer saline.The article discusses the synthesis of radioactive gold nanostructures with four different shapes and their biodistribution in a murine EMT6 breast cancer model. The study found that the shape of the nanostructure affects its ability to penetrate through the tumor, with nanorods having a better chance of penetrating due to their small size. The hollow core of the nanocage also increased its convective and diffusive properties in the tumor tissue, allowing it to flow through tumor microvasculature, leak out through pores, and diffuse through interstitial tumor space to reach microenvironments inside the entire tumor. The biodistribution was quantified by measuring the radioactivity in various organs and tissues.The article discusses the biodistribution of four different shapes of gold nanoparticles (nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages) in a tumor model using radiation from 198Au. The nanospheres showed the best blood circulation, lowest clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, and highest overall tumor uptake. Nanorods and nanocages were able to reach the cores of the tumors, while nanospheres and nanodisks were only observed on the surfaces of the tumors. The study suggests that nanorods and nanocages have unique positions for photothermal cancer treatment. The article also discusses the materials and methods used in the experiment, including the preparation of radioactive H198AuCl4. Future studies should focus on improving the blood circulation half-life and pharmacokinetics of these Au nanostructures and testing them in other tumor models.The article describes the preparation of four types of radioactive gold nanoparticles: nanodisks, nanocages, nanospheres, and nanorods. The nanoparticles were synthesized using a variety of methods, including etching, galvanic replacement, and seed-mediated growth. The nanoparticles were purified and reconstituted in various solutions, including hydrochloric acid and ultrapure water. The article does not discuss the biodistribution of the nanoparticles.Gold nanorods were synthesized using a seed-mediated method with CTAB as a capping agent. The nanorods were then PEGylated and their morphology was examined using TEM. The nanorods were injected into mice with EMT6 murine mammary carcinoma cells and their biodistribution was studied.The experiment involved injecting nanospheres, nanodisks, nanorods, and nanocages into EMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice via the tail vein. The mice were euthanized 1, 6, or 24 hours after injection, and organs were collected, weighed, and counted to calculate the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue. In vivo luminescence imaging was performed on two mice, and autoradiographic imaging was done on excised tumors. The experiment aimed to study the biodistribution of the nanomaterials in vivo.The biodistribution of nanomaterials was studied in EMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice using autoradiography, photoacoustic imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET). Autoradiography was performed on 820 slices of the mice using an Instant Imager Electronic Autoradiography system. Photoacoustic imaging was performed using a tunable dye laser and a 50 MHz ultrasound transducer. PET imaging was performed using a microPET R4 scanner. The results showed that the nanomaterials accumulated in the liver, spleen, and lungs, with some accumulation in the tumor. The study demonstrated the potential of these imaging techniques for studying the biodistribution of nanomaterials in vivo.The article describes a study on the biodistribution of nanomaterials in EMT6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. PET imaging was performed using 18F-FDG and 64Cu-ATSM to measure tumor glucose uptake and hypoxia, respectively. The mice were injected with 11.1 MBq of 18F-FDG and 3 MBq of 64Cu-ATSM via the tail vein and dynamic scans were acquired every 5 minutes until 1 hour post-injection. The images were analyzed using Inveon software. The study was supported by a grant from the NCI and startup funds from Georgia Institute of Technology.

The experiment focuses on the biodistribution of the nanocages in mice, specifically in tumor tissue. The study considers the factors that control the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and intratumoral penetration of nanoparticles. The article also mentions the influence of size, shape, and vessel geometry on nanoparticle distribution. The authors use real-time intravital imaging to observe the binding of RGD-quantum dots to luminal endothelium in mouse tumor neovasculature. The study concludes that hyperthermia enables tumor-specific nanoparticle delivery, and the flow and adhesion of drug carriers in blood vessels depend on their shape.The article discusses the effects of nanoparticle shape and size on their biodistribution in vivo. It cites several studies that have investigated the relationship between nanoparticle shape and cellular uptake, tumor penetration, and extravasation through nanopores. The studies use a variety of techniques to synthesize and characterize nanoparticles, including seeded growth synthesis and polymeric nanostructure shape control.

      "The article discusses the use of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for photothermal therapy (PTT) in cancer treatment. The study examines the use of T cells as cellular delivery vehicles for AuNP transport into tumors. The experiment involves injecting AuNPs intravenously and allowing them to accumulate within the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The tumor is then irradiated with a near infrared laser, whose energy is absorbed by the AuNPs and translated into heat. The study aims to improve the efficiency and specificity of tumor delivery in vivo, particularly in tumors with poor blood supply. The experiment demonstrates that T cells can be efficiently loaded with 45 nm gold colloid nanoparticles.The article discusses the use of T cells to deliver gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for cancer treatment. The study found that AuNP-loaded T cells retained their function and were able to migrate to tumor sites in vivo. The use of T cells increased the efficiency of AuNP delivery to tumors by more than four-fold compared to injection of free PEGylated AuNPs. The overall nanoparticle biodistribution was also altered by the use of T cell delivery. The article highlights the potential of using T cell chaperones for AuNP delivery to enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle-based therapies and imaging applications. The article also provides background information on the use of AuNPs for photothermal therapy and the enhanced permeability and retention effect for nanoparticle delivery to tumors.The biodistribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the body is low, with high accumulation in non-target sites such as the liver and spleen. Attempts to improve tumor delivery and specificity have included nanoparticle surface modifications, but these have only modestly improved tumor accumulation and specificity. Macrophages have been used as a cellular delivery vehicle to deposit AuNPs in tumors and hypoxic tumor tissues, but T cells may be a more efficient option. T cells are readily isolated and expanded in vitro, and upon infusion, circulate throughout the body and migrate into tumors in response to tumor-associated chemokines. Combining the advantages of T cells with nanotechnology has the potential to generate innovative new approaches to cancer therapy.The article explores the use of T cells as carriers of gold colloidal nanospheres (40-45 nm) for delivery to tumor sites in vivo. The study demonstrates that gold colloid is readily taken up by activated human T cells without impairing their viability or cellular functions. The synthesized gold colloid was determined to be 40-45 nm in diameter. The possible applications of a AuNP-T cell delivery system could further be extended to imaging and drug delivery applications. The study shows that AuNPs can be more efficiently delivered to distant tumor sites following intravenous infusion into tumor-bearing mice.The article describes a study on the optimal conditions for loading human T cells with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using different concentrations and incubation times. The number of nanoparticles per T cell was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. The study found that a maximum of 14,900 2,400 AuNPs can be internalized per T cell using a concentration of 0.5 nM AuNP and an incubation period of 24 hours. The study also found that AuNP-loading did not affect T cell viability or function.The article investigates the potential toxicity of st-AuNP loading on T cell performance as an in vivo delivery vehicle. The study found that loading T cells with AuNPs did not have an immediate effect on T cell viability, phenotype, or proliferation. Additionally, AuNPs did not affect T cell migration or the production of IFN- following mitogen activation. The study also found that T cells loaded with AuNPs were able to migrate and transport AuNPs to tumors in vivo. Bioluminescent imaging and histology showed specific migration of the T cells to subcutaneous LCL tumors in immune deficient SCID mice.The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) delivered by T cells in vivo. T cells were loaded with AuNPs and injected into mice with subcutaneous xenografted LCL tumors. Bioluminescent imaging showed that AuNP-T cells localized at the tumor site and within the spleen. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that T cells infiltrated the tumor and maintained internalized AuNPs during migration to the tumor site. The biodistribution of free PEGylated AuNPs and AuNPs delivered by T cells was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ICP-OES. Organs were harvested and analyzed for gold levels at different time points. The study found that delivery of AuNPs by T cells altered nanoparticle biodistribution.The study compares the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and AuNPs delivered by T cells. PEG-AuNPs were found to accumulate in the liver and spleen, while AuNP-T cells delivered AuNPs to the lung, liver, and spleen. The plasma half-life of PEG-AuNPs was 6.05 hours, and no gold was detected in the plasma for the AuNP-T cell group. The biodistribution of AuNP-T cells correlates with the normal biodistribution of human T cells. The study suggests that cellular delivery of AuNPs results in a unique biodistribution pattern dependent on the cell type used for delivery. T cell delivery increases tumor accumulation of AuNPs.The article discusses the use of T cells to transport gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to tumor sites for photothermal cancer therapy and optical imaging. The study found that the highest level of accumulation in tumors was observed at 24 hours post-injection for PEG-AuNPs, while peak tumor gold accumulation following T cell delivery was seen at 48 hours. Using PEG-AuNP, 0.39 ± 0.33% of ID reached the tumor at 24 hours, whereas using AuNP-T cells, 1.55 ± 0.72% of the ID localized to the tumor at 48 hours, representing a four-fold increase in the efficiency of AuNP delivery to the tumor site using T cells as vehicles. T cells loaded with AuNPs retain their ability to migrate in vitro and demonstrate tumor-specific homing in mice.The article discusses the use of gold colloidal nanospheres (AuNPs) for internalization by activated human T cells to improve tumor localization. The size of the AuNPs was selected to optimize cellular uptake, and the degree of internalization was modulated by altering the concentration of nanoparticles incubated with the T cells. The internalized gold colloid had no detrimental impact on the viability or function of activated human T cells in vitro, and the T cells were able to migrate to tumors in vivo while maintaining their AuNP payload. The study suggests that internal loading of AuNPs in T cells may be a useful technology for nanoparticle-based therapies.The article discusses the use of T cells for tumor-specificity in adoptive immunotherapy studies. Systemically administered AuNPs tend to accumulate mainly in the perivascular regions of the tumor, limiting passive accumulation of nanoparticles by the EPR effect to well-vascularized regions of the tumor. Freely injected nanoparticles accumulate most significantly in well-vascularized organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, and gut. After adoptive transfer of AuNP-T cells, a large percentage of the ID is seen within the liver and lungs at 24 h. T cells are known to accumulate within the liver and lungs after administration due to the vascularity and number of adhesion molecules present in these organs.The article discusses the use of T cells as a vehicle for delivering gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to tumors in mice. The biodistribution of AuNP-T cells matches the expected biodistribution of normal activated T cells, suggesting that AuNP biodistribution can be modulated based on the selection of the cellular vehicle. The study shows that using T cells as a vehicle for AuNP delivery results in a four-fold increase in tumor delivery efficiency compared to freely injected PEG-coated AuNPs. The use of AuNPs and T cells together combines the photothermal therapy and imaging advantages of AuNPs with the immunotherapy and biodistribution advantages of T cells. Future directions will focus on utilizing the AuNP-T cell system for cancer therapy by modifying the T cells to further enrich AuNP tumor accumulation and enhance anti-tumor effects.The article discusses the use of T cells as a vehicle for delivering AuNP to tumor sites in vivo, which enhances in vivo delivery efficiency by four-fold. The article describes the synthesis and PEGylation of AuNP, which were sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 m polyethersulfone filter. The PEGylated particle stability was confirmed by increasing solution tonicity with 1 M NaCl. The hydrodynamic diameter of the PEGylated gold colloid was assessed using dynamic light scattering measurements. Peripheral blood was used for T cell isolation and preparation. The article suggests that the selection of a particular cellular vehicle may dictate AuNP biodistribution.The study used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors to generate EBV-transformed B cells lines (LCL) and T cell lines. T cells were expanded and transduced in IL-2 supplemented media. On day 7, T cells were harvested and suspended in complete RPMI supplemented with different concentrations of AuNPs for 24 h. T cells were imaged using darkfield microscopy and quantitatively characterized using ICP-OES analysis. T cells incubated with media alone were used as a control. The study aimed to determine the effect of AuNP loading on T cell phenotype.The article describes an experiment to assess the effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) on T cells. The viability and proliferation of T cells were measured using an Annexin V apoptosis detection kit and a [3H] thymidine incorporation assay, respectively. The ability of AuNP-loaded T cells to migrate and secrete IFN- was also measured using a transwell migration assay and mitogenic stimulation, respectively. Chromium51 was used to label T cells for the migration assay. The experiment was conducted using 96-well round bottom plates and transwell chambers. The results were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, FCSExpress software, and a TriCarb 2500 RT-counter.The article describes in vivo migration, AuNP delivery, and biodistribution studies using severe combined immune deficient mice (SCID). The mice were injected with either PBS, 1 107 AuNP-T cells, or 1 1011 PEGylated AuNPs via the tail vein in a 200 L bolus. Tumors were resected at either 4, 8, 24, or 48 h for the PEGylated AuNP group and 24 or 48 h for the AuNP-T cell group. Plasma as well as portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys, small intestine, muscle, heart, lung, bone, and brain were also collected for analysis. All tissues, including tumors, were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen after collection and stored at -80C until analysis.In this experiment, T cells were loaded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and injected intravenously into mice. The biodistribution of T cells was visualized using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) 48 hours post-infusion. Tumors were imaged using bright field and dark field microscopy after embedding in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound. Resected mouse tissues were analyzed for gold content using ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's method and a Student's t-test. The study found significant differences between AuNP and AuNP-T cell delivery to tumors.The article describes the in vitro and in vivo characterization of gold nanorods (AuNPs) for photothermal therapy (PTT) of squamous cell carcinoma in mice. The biodistribution of AuNPs was studied after intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), and intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The results showed that the highest accumulation of AuNPs was observed in the liver and spleen, and the clearance of AuNPs was slower after i.p. injection. The authors also investigated the effect of AuNP-loading on T cell phenotype and found no significant changes. The study was funded by various organizations.The article discusses the use of nanomaterials for thermal therapy of tumors. The experiment involved the use of nanoshells and nanorods to target cancer cells and destroy them through photothermal ablation therapy. The study also explored the biodistribution of the nanomaterials in vivo and their efficiency in mediating tumor targeting. The experiment was conducted under magnetic resonance guidance and in orthotopic canine models. The study found that the nanomaterials were effective in compromising membrane integrity and inducing tumor cell death. The article suggests that the design of nanoparticles can mediate tumor targeting efficiency.The article discusses the biodistribution of gold nanoshells and nanorods in mice for photothermal tumor therapy. The study used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and neutron activation analysis to track the accumulation and clearance of the nanomaterials in various organs. The results showed that the nanomaterials accumulated in the liver, spleen, and lungs, with some accumulation in the tumor. The study also explored the use of T cells as vehicles for targeted delivery of adenoviral vectors for cancer gene therapy.The article discusses the potential use of human T cells as carriers of therapeutic nanoparticles for cancer treatment. The biodistribution of nanomaterials is a crucial factor in their effectiveness, and several studies have investigated the use of gold nanoparticles for photothermal cancer therapy. Near-infrared resonant nanoshells have been developed for combined optical imaging and photothermal therapy, and gold nanorods have been used for cancer cell imaging and therapy. Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies conjugated to gold nanoparticles have been used for real-time optical imaging of precancer. Additionally, EBV-specific T lymphocytes transduced with a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor have shown antitumor activity.The article discusses the biodistribution of nanomaterials in therapeutic cell engineering. The experiment involved the use of synthetic nanoparticles conjugated to cell surfaces. The size and shape of gold nanoparticles were found to affect their uptake into mammalian cells. The cellular response to nanoparticle-mediated therapy was also found to be size-dependent. The article also discusses the use of cytotoxic T lymphocyte therapy for the treatment of Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoma in allogeneic transplant recipients. The use of virus-specific T cells engineered to co-express tumor-specific receptors was found to have antitumor activity in individuals with neuroblastoma. The tumor trafficking of GD2 chimeric antigen receptor T cells was enhanced by the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR2b.The biodistribution and retention time of retrovirally labeled T lymphocytes in mice were studied. The culture period before infusion strongly influenced biodistribution and retention time. The liver was identified as a site of T-cell apoptosis. T lymphocytes co-expressing CCR4 and a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD30 showed improved homing and antitumor activity in a Hodgkin tumor model.

      "The article discusses the conversion of rod-shaped gold nanoparticles to spherical forms and their effect on biodistribution in tumor-bearing mice. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between the shape of gold nanorods and their biodistribution after intravenous injection. Two types of gold nanorods were prepared, which had distinct aspect ratios but had the same volume, zeta potential, and PEG density on the gold surface. The biodistributions of the two types of gold nanorods after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice were then compared. Although a slight difference in accumulation in the spleen was observed, no significant difference was found in the biodistribution of the two types of gold nanorods. The study concludes that the shape of gold nanorods does not significantly affect their biodistribution in tumor-bearing mice.Gold nanorods are rod-shaped gold particles that have two absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared regions. They absorb NIR light, making them suitable for in vivo applications such as imaging and photoradiation therapy. Gold nanorods are prepared in the presence of CTAB, which stabilizes them. Biocompatible gold nanorods have been prepared by coating with phosphatidylcholine or modifying with PEG. PEG-modified gold nanorods show high dispersion stability, circulation stability, and accumulation in tumors mediated by the EPR effect. The size and aspect ratio of gold nanorods are important factors in their uptake into cells and biodistribution. In this study, the biodistribution of gold nanorods with an aspect ratio range of 1.7 to 5.0, diameter of 10 to 50 nm, and volume of approximately 4103 nm3 was dependent mainly on surface characteristics, PEG density, and zeta potential. No significant difference was observed in the liver, lung, kidney, and tumors.The article compares the biodistribution of two types of gold nanorods with different aspect ratios but identical volume, zeta potential, and surface structure. The nanorods were injected intravenously into tumor-bearing mice, and their biodistribution was compared. The gold nanorods were prepared by modifying the as-obtained gold nanorods with PEG chains. The study found that the biodistribution of the gold nanorods was affected by their geometry, with the nanorods of lower aspect ratio accumulating more efficiently in tumors and less efficiently in the liver compared to the nanospheres. The study highlights the importance of considering other parameters, such as cellular uptake, when examining the effect of the geometry of gold nanoparticles on biodistribution. The animal experiments were undertaken according to the Guidelines for Animal Care and Use Committee, Kyushu University.The article describes an experiment involving the use of a pulsed laser to irradiate a mixture of gold nanorods, CTAB, and PEG reagent. The mixture was then stirred and centrifuged to remove excess reagents. The PEG-modified gold nanorods were characterized using various techniques, including absorption spectra measurements, transmission electron microscopy, and elemental analyses. The zeta potentials of the gold nanorod suspensions were also evaluated. The biodistribution of the PEG-modified gold nanorods was studied in tumor-bearing mice, which were prepared by injecting colon-26 cells subcutaneously into the abdomen. The tumors were allowed to grow for 5 days before the experiment.In this study, PEG-modified gold nanorods with different aspect ratios were injected into tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein. The doses of the nanorods were 1.01 and 1.05 mM of gold concentration in 10 L/g body weight of 5% glucose solution for aspect ratios of 5.0 and 1.7, respectively. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours after injection, and blood, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, and tumor samples were collected. Gold concentrations were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with thallium as the internal standard. The study aimed to investigate the effect of aspect ratio on the biodistribution of gold nanorods in mice. The original gold nanorods with higher aspect ratio were transformed to those of lower aspect ratio by irradiation with laser light. The results showed that the aspect ratio of gold nanorods affects their biodistribution in mice.The article discusses the effects of near-infrared pulsed laser light on PEG-modified gold nanorods. The size distribution and aspect ratios of the nanorods were measured before and after laser irradiation. The short axis of the nanorods increased in size while the long axis decreased, resulting in an overlap in size distribution. Half of the irradiated nanorods became spherical while the other half became elliptical. The particle length of the short axis increased from 10.6 to 17.2 nm, while the long axis decreased from 49.6 to 27.0 nm. The aspect ratio decreased from 5.0 to 1.7. The surface area decreased from 1.61103 nm2 to 1.42103 nm2, but the volume did not change significantly. The article also mentions previous reports of fragmentation or fusion of gold nanorods under pulsed laser light.The article discusses the effects of near-infrared pulsed laser light on PEG-modified gold nanorods. The laser light did not cause fragmentation or fusion of the nanorods, likely due to the intensity of the light and the PEG layer on the nanorods. The amount of modified PEG on the nanorods decreased slightly with laser irradiation, but the PEG density and zeta potential remained unchanged. The laser irradiation caused the nanorods to transform from a rod shape to a spherical shape without changing the volume, PEG density, or zeta potential. The biodistribution of the nanorods was compared in tumor-bearing mice with different aspect ratios but the same volume, PEG density, and zeta potentials.The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution of PEG-modified gold nanorods in tumor-bearing mice. The mice were intravenously injected with either aspect ratios of 5.0 or 1.7 gold nanorods. After 72 hours, the mice were sacrificed, and their organs were collected and dissolved using aqua regia. The gold concentrations in the samples were measured by ICP-MS. The results showed that both types of injected gold nanorods accumulated mainly in the liver and spleen. Most gold nanorods were cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the liver and spleen. The concentration of accumulated gold nanorods in the organs was slightly lower in the spleen for aspect ratio 1.7 compared to aspect ratio 5.0, although statistical significance was low. No difference was observed in the tumors, suggesting that a change in the shape of the gold nanorods was not sufficient to influence the EPR effect in the tumors. The slight difference observed in the spleen may have been due to physical filtration in this organ.The study aimed to investigate the effect of shape and surface characteristics of gold nanorods on their biodistribution after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice. The shape of the gold nanorods was changed by irradiation with NIR light to a spherical form, and two types of PEG-modified gold nanorods with distinct aspect ratios but with the same volume, PEG density, and zeta potential were obtained. The results showed that the shape of the gold nanorods barely affected their biodistribution except for that in the spleen. The biodistribution of gold nanorods in the aspect ratio range of 1.7 to 5.0 and size of 10 to 50 nm at a volume of approximately 4103 nm3 is dependent mainly on the surface characteristics, PEG density, and zeta potential. The study suggests that the application of gold nanorods to therapeutic use can be achieved by irradiating them with NIR light to induce shape change and release of molecules bound on the gold nanorods without changing their biodistribution.The article discusses the use of gold nanorods for drug delivery and heating systems. The nanorods can be heated using light without changing their shape, making them advantageous over other types of nanoparticles.

The research was supported by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The article cites several other studies on gold nanorods and their optical properties.The biodistribution of gold nanorods (GNRs) was investigated in tumor-bearing mice. The GNRs were modified with phosphatidylcholine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to reduce cytotoxicity and increase stealth character for in vivo applications. The effects of PEG grafting level and injection dose on GNR biodistribution were studied. The GNRs were monitored in vivo using near-infrared light. Gold nanorod-assisted near-infrared plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) was used to treat squamous cell carcinoma in mice. Computationally guided photothermal tumor therapy was performed using long-circulating gold nanorod antennas. A gold nanorod-photosensitizer complex was used for near-infrared fluorescence imaging and photodynamic/photothermal therapy in vivo. The size and shape dependence of gold nanoparticle uptake into mammalian cells was determined. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of GNRs were studied, and the molecular origin of cytotoxicity and surface effects were investigated.The article discusses the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in vivo. The size, shape, and surface chemistry of the nanoparticles are found to affect their cellular uptake and organ distribution. The study uses both intravenous administration and photoirradiation processes to synthesize the nanoparticles. The results show that smaller particles have a higher distribution in the liver and spleen, while larger particles accumulate in the lungs. The aspect ratio of the nanoparticles also affects their uptake by macrophages. The study concludes that the geometry and surface characteristics of the nanoparticles play a crucial role in their biodistribution and uptake by cells.The article discusses the biodistribution of nanomaterials, specifically gold nanoclusters and gold nanorods.

      "The article describes the development and characterization of a multifunctional gold nanorod-based nanoplatform for targeted anticancer drug delivery and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumors. The nanoplatform consists of PEGylated GNR nanocarriers conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX) via a hydrazone bond for pH-sensitive controlled drug release. The nanocarriers are also conjugated with tumor-targeting ligands, cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys) (cRGD), for enhanced tumor accumulation. The biodistribution of the nanoplatform was studied in mice, and the results showed that the nanoplatform had high tumor accumulation and low uptake in non-targeted organs. The nanoplatform has potential for combined cancer therapy and PET imaging.The article discusses the use of gold nanorods (GNRs) as a drug delivery system for cancer treatment. The GNRs were conjugated with cRGD peptides and 64Cu-chelators to achieve active tumor-targeting and PET imaging, respectively. In vitro studies showed that the cRGD-conjugated nanocarriers had higher cellular uptake and cytotoxicity than non-targeted ones. However, in vivo studies showed that both targeted and non-targeted nanocarriers had similar biodistribution. The article suggests that the unique optical properties of GNRs can potentially be optimized for combined cancer therapies and multimodality imaging. The article highlights the potential of nanocarriers in addressing the challenges of current cancer treatments.The article discusses the potential of nanocarriers to improve drug delivery and enhance therapeutic efficacy. The focus of nanomedicine is to develop multifunctional tumor-targeting drug/agent nanocarriers, including those capable of co-delivering anti-cancer drugs and imaging contrast agents. Molecular imaging, particularly PET imaging, has become increasingly popular in both preclinical and clinical settings to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution of various nanoparticles/nanocarriers. However, multimodality imaging is often applied in clinical oncology as no single modality is sufficient to collect all necessary information for a particular assessment. Recently, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has emerged as a complement to radionuclide-based imaging techniques as it offers convenient, non-invasive, non-radioactive, real-time, and high-resolution imaging of diseased tissues.The article reports on a multifunctional and water-soluble gold nanorod-based nanoplatform that integrates chemotherapy, PET imaging, and molecular targeting into one system. The nanoplatform was designed to achieve a pH-responsive drug release profile and specifically bind to integrin v3 that is overexpressed on sprouting tumor vessels and many tumor cells. The nanoplatform was also conjugated with a macrocyclic 64Cu chelator for PET imaging to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and tumor-targeting efficacy of the nanocarriers. The article provides details on the materials and methods used in the experiment, including the purchase and use of various chemicals and reagents.The article describes the preparation of gold nanorods (GNRs) using a two-step seed-mediated growth method with a slight modification. The GNRs were synthesized using CTAB surfactant solution and were capped with CTAB. The heterobifunctional PEG derivative, R-PEG114-NHS, was used to functionalize the GNRs. The anti-cancer drug, doxorubicinHCl, and the c(RGDfC) peptide were also used in the experiment. The biodistribution of the functionalized GNRs was studied in U87MG human glioblastoma cells expressing high levels of integrin v3 40. The 64Cu-labeling was performed using pre-treated Millipore grade water and all buffers were heavy-metal free.Gold nanorods (GNRs) were synthesized by mixing AgNO3 and HAuCl4 solutions with AA as a reducing agent and CTAB-capped Au nanoparticle seeds. The resulting GNRs were washed and separated from the reaction solution via centrifugation. MTG and AET linkers were anchored to the surface of the GNRs, followed by PEGylation using a mixture of MPEG-NHS and Mal-PEG-NHS. The resulting solution was purified by dialysis and filtration. The study aimed to conjugate DOX onto the GNRs for targeted drug delivery.The article describes the conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) onto gold nanorods (GNRs) through a two-step reaction. The first step involved substituting the methoxy groups of MTG with anhydrous hydrazide, followed by purification through dialysis and freeze-drying. In the second step, DOX was conjugated to the hydrazide group of the GNRs through a pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage. The GNRs were also conjugated with cRGD and NOTA through a reaction between the Mal groups on the surface of GNRs with the thiol groups of cRGD and/or thiol-functionalized NOTA. The DOX loading content was quantified by UV-Vis analysis.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of gold nanorods (GNRs) conjugated with cRGD peptide and doxorubicin (DOX) for targeted drug delivery. The drug loading capacity (DLC) of the GNR nanocarriers was determined by measuring the absorbance of DOX at 485 nm. The morphology of the GNRs and GNR nanocarriers was characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectra, zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pH-responsive DOX release behavior of the GNR nanocarriers was studied in three mediums with different pH values. Cellular uptake of the GNR nanocarriers was analyzed using flow cytometry.The article describes an experiment to study the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of gold nanorods (GNR) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) in U87MG cells. The DOX uptake was analyzed using flow cytometry and the cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. The experiment was repeated three times and significant differences in mean DOX fluorescence and cytotoxicity between treatment groups were determined using a two-tailed Student's t-test with p < 0.05 being considered significant. Animal studies were conducted using female athymic nude mice with established tumors. The tumor sizes were monitored every other day and the animals were subjected to in vivo experiments when the tumors reached a certain size.The study involved the use of gold nanorods (GNRs) as nanocarriers for targeted and non-targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) to tumors in mice. The GNRs were labeled with 64Cu using NOTA conjugation. PET scans were performed on U87MG tumor-bearing mice injected with the tracer via tail vein, and biodistribution studies were carried out ex vivo. The diameter of the tumors reached 6-8 mm, and the radioactive fractions containing GNR-DOX-64Cu or GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu were collected for in vivo experiments. The study used a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent model scanner and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm for image reconstruction.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of gold nanorods (GNRs) for potential use in photothermal therapy. The GNRs were functionalized with thiolated linkers for conjugation with doxorubicin (DOX) and cRGD. Biodistribution studies were conducted in tumor-bearing mice injected with GNR-DOX-64Cu or GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu. MicroPET imaging was used to confirm tracer distribution, and radioactivity in collected tissues was measured. The GNRs had a length and diameter of approximately 45 and 10 nm, respectively, and exhibited two absorption bands. The zeta potential was determined to be 42 mV due to the cationic surfactant used during synthesis.The article discusses the conjugation of MTG and AET linkers to gold nanorods (GNRs) to create GNR nanocarriers. The molar ratio of MTG and AET was set at 1:1 to maximize DOX loading while retaining solubility and stability. The average number of MTG and AET arms attached to a given GNR was estimated to be ~1,000 each. Mal-PEG-NHS and MPEG-NHS were coupled onto the AET linkers at a molar ratio of 2:3. DOX was then conjugated to the GNR nanocarriers via an acid-sensitive hydrazone linkage. The resulting GNR nanocarriers were stable in physiological conditions and had a high DOX loading level.The article describes the preparation of pH-sensitive gold nanorod (GNR) nanocarriers conjugated with cRGD and NOTA for targeted drug delivery. The amount of doxorubicin (DOX) incorporated into the GNR nanocarriers was determined to be 0.84 wt.%. In vitro drug release studies showed that DOX release from the GNR nanocarriers was governed by the acid-cleavable hydrazone linkage, with faster release at pH values of 5.3 and 6.6. The pH-sensitive GNR nanocarriers were found to enhance tumor-directed therapeutic efficacy while minimizing non-specific systemic spread of toxicity. The article also discusses the cellular uptake and distribution of the GNR nanocarriers.The study investigated the cellular uptake of gold nanorods (GNRs) conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX) and cRGD peptide, a potent integrin v3 antagonist, in U87MG human glioblastoma cell line. Flow cytometry was performed to compare the cellular uptake of GNR-DOX-cRGD, GNR-DOX, free DOX, and untreated control cells at early (15 min) and late (120 min) time points. The results showed that conjugating cRGD to GNRs increased their cellular uptake by 2.2-fold at the early time point and 4.5-fold at the late time point compared to non-targeted GNRs. Targeting V3 integrin expressed on U87MG cells is an effective means of increasing the uptake of GNR-DOX-cRGD.The article discusses the use of gold nanorods (GNRs) as drug carriers for cancer treatment. The GNRs were conjugated with cRGD peptides to target V3 integrin on tumor cells. The study found that the level of cellular uptake of the GNR nanocarriers directly correlated with cytotoxicity. MicroPET studies showed that the uptake of GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu in the liver was prominent at early time points and gradually declined over time. The article concludes that increasing cell uptake using cRGD peptides conjugated onto the GNR nanocarriers can directly increase cellular destruction.The article reports on the biodistribution of gold nanorods (GNRs) conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) in mice. The circulation half-lives of the GNRs were short, with liver uptake being the highest. Tumor uptake was visible at 1 hour post-injection (p.i.) and gradually decreased over time. Conjugating cRGD onto the GNRs did not confer a significant advantage in tumor uptake in vivo over passive targeting due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Biodistribution studies showed that uptake in all tissues dropped significantly at 48 hours p.i., suggesting that the uptake of both GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu nanocarriers was largely based on the EPR effect rather than the cRGD-integrin v3 interaction.The article discusses the challenges of achieving efficient in vivo tumor targeting using nanocarriers conjugated with active tumor-targeting ligands such as antibodies and peptides. The study found that although in vitro experiments demonstrated an increase in integrin v3-mediated uptake of GNR-DOX-cRGD over GNR-DOX in U87MG cells, there was no significant difference in the U87MG tumor uptake in vivo between GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu nanocarriers. The biodistribution data of GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu at 48 h p.i. revealed a corroborating distribution pattern for GNR-DOX-cRGD-64Cu and GNR-DOX-64Cu nanocarriers in vivo. The quantification results obtained from biodistribution studies and PET scans matched very well, confirming that quantitative ROI analysis of non-invasive microPET scans truly reflected the distribution of PET tracers in vivo.The article discusses the development of multifunctional water-soluble gold nanorod (GNR) nanocarriers for tumor-targeted drug delivery and PET imaging. The GNR nanocarriers exhibit pH-sensitive drug release behavior, which can minimize non-specific systemic spread of toxic drugs during circulation while maximizing the efficiency of tumor-targeted anticancer drug delivery. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that the cRGD-conjugated GNR nanocarriers showed a higher cellular uptake and thus a more potent cytotoxicity in cancer cells overexpressing V3 integrin when compared to the cRGD-free GNR nanocarriers. Although the cRGD-conjugated GNR nanocarriers did not show any significant increases in tumor accumulation according to both the in vivo PET imaging and biodistribution studies, this study does provide a novel nanoplatform for possible integration of multi-functionality including molecular targeting, chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, as well as multimodality imaging such as PET/optical, which can potentially lead to improved therapeutic efficacy and cancer monitoring.The article acknowledges funding from the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health for research on the biodistribution of nanomaterials.

      "The article discusses the use of gold nanorods (AuNR) in cancer diagnostics and therapy due to their plasmonic photothermal properties. The size and aspect ratio of AuNR can be tuned to tailor the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the NIR spectrum, enabling specific and effective treatment. The article proposes a systematic framework to investigate the size-dependent kinetics of AuNRs during enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) mediated tumor delivery. The in vivo uptake and kinetics of 64Cu-labeled AuNRs during blood circulation, tumor accumulation, and elimination were studied using positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling. The results suggest an optimum size of AuNR for EPR mediated tumor delivery.The article discusses the use of nano-sized particles as a strategy for intravascular drug delivery. Nanoparticles can permeate into tumor tissue via the leaky endothelium and stay within the diseased tissue due to the compromised lymphatic drainage of the tumor, known as the enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR). However, nanoparticles can be recognized and eliminated by the liver and macrophage phagocytic system (MPS) during blood circulation or excretion by the renal system for those smaller than 5 nm. The article focuses on the in vivo behavior of gold nanorods (AuNR) and their potential for cancer imaging and therapy. The study uses positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling to understand the biodistribution of AuNR. The criteria for designing nanoparticles for efficient delivery in solid tumors include prolonged circulation half-life, enhanced EPR effect for high tumor accumulation, and low uptake by the liver and MPS.The article discusses the impact of different properties of gold nanoparticles on their interaction with the biological environment and homing to tumors. The surface coating of the nanoparticles with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) prevents protein serum binding and plasma clearance by macrophages, prolonging blood circulation and increasing drug concentration in tumors. Size and shape also affect circulation, biodistribution, and tumor accumulation. Rod-shaped gold nanoparticles (AuNRs) have unique optical and photothermal properties, making them promising for cancer imaging, drug delivery, and therapy. Tuning the size and aspect ratio of AuNRs allows for specific and effective treatment. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the effect of size and aspect ratio on the kinetics and tissue uptake of AuNRs during intravascular delivery and tumor extravasation.The article discusses the biodistribution of nanomaterials, specifically gold nanorods (AuNRs), in vivo. The effect of aspect ratio on nanorod biodistribution and tumor homing has been studied with nucleoprotein-based nanorods in vivo with fluorescence imaging. The kinetics of blood circulation and tumor accumulation have been investigated with theoretical simulation and in vitro with copper oxide nanorod conducted under ideal experimental conditions. However, the size effect of AuNR on the in vivo kinetics remains unclear. The article proposes a quantitative framework to investigate the size effect on the EPR-mediated tumor delivery kinetics. The study uses positron emission tomography (PET) with 64Cu-labeled PEGylated AuNR to investigate the size-dependent kinetics of AuNRs during their tumor delivery.The article investigates the effect of different sizes of gold nanorods (AuNR) on their biodistribution in vivo. Five different sizes of AuNR were used, and their volume and aspect ratio were measured. Smaller AuNRs were found to have higher diffusiveness and margination capacity. The cytotoxicity study showed that all AuNRs were safe for in vivo use. The ex vivo biodistribution study showed a positive correlation between in vivo PET uptake and ex vivo biodistribution. A kinetics model was proposed to assess the EPR effect on tumor uptake of AuNR.The study aimed to assess the kinetics of EPR-mediated tumor delivery using a two-compartment model. The model consisted of a central compartment for blood pool and a peripheral compartment for concentration in tumor extravascular space. The blood circulation and MPS elimination of 64Cu-AuNR were evaluated to determine efficient EPR-mediated tumor delivery. The smallest AuNR P1 showed the highest mean blood retention over the entire 48 h period, while the P4 and P5 had the lowest mean blood retention. A negative dependence was found between the blood uptake and AuNR volume. The T1/2 of each AuNR was calculated, and a strong linear correlation was found between the T1/2 and the Vrod.The article discusses the biodistribution of different sizes of gold nanorods (AuNR) in mice. Smaller AuNRs with high aspect ratio have longer blood circulation time due to their diffusiveness and ability to avoid engulfment by macrophages. However, larger AuNRs are cleared faster by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and accumulate more in the liver and spleen. The study found that the blood circulation of AuNR is mainly affected by its volume rather than aspect ratio. No significant correlation was found between in vivo liver and spleen uptake with all five sizes of AuNR.The study investigated the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNRs) of different sizes and aspect ratios in mice. The smallest AuNRs (P1) were found to be cleared faster from the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) than larger ones, reducing toxicity. However, even AuNRs with high aspect ratios were capable of evading MPS elimination and staying in circulation for improved tumor uptake. The transportation kinetics from blood to tumor and vice versa were represented by the kinetics rate constant K1 and k2, respectively. Larger AuNRs extravasated faster from tumor vasculature, contrary to previous in vitro studies.The study investigated the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNRs) in tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The volume of distribution (VD) was used to evaluate the kinetics rate related to the EPR effect. The study found that the net trans-endothelium kinetics rate through EPR effect was insensitive to the variation of the AuNR size. The retention of AuNRs in the tumor was characterized by using the AuNR's total tumor residence time (tumor AUC) and tumor uptake at later time points (24 h and 48 h). The P1 and P4 showed higher tumor uptake over the 48 h p.i. compared to other sizes of AuNR. The tumor AUC was strongly correlated with the tumor maximum uptake.The article discusses the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNR) in mice with tumors. The aspect ratio of the AuNR was found to have a moderate correlation with tumor uptake at 24 and 48 hours post-injection. Anisotropic AuNR with higher aspect ratios were found to have higher tumor accumulation than those with lower aspect ratios. However, there was high inter-subject variation in tumor uptake, especially at early time points, resulting in less significant differences in tumor uptake between different sizes of AuNR. The study suggests that the anisotropic structure of AuNR is advantageous for tumor accumulation.The study aimed to investigate the relationship between tumor vasculature and the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNRs) in mice. Two different sizes of 64Cu-AuNRs were injected into U87MG tumor-bearing mice, and their tumor uptake was compared with ex vivo tumor vascular density and permeability. The results showed a strong correlation between in vivo tumor uptake and CD31 staining count, indicating that high (low) tumor uptake could be a result of abundant (insufficient) tumor vasculature. However, there was no correlation between in vivo tumor uptake and EB staining, suggesting that vascular permeability was independent of AuNR tumor uptake.The article investigates the effect of gold nanorod (AuNR) size on their tumor delivery kinetics through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The study used PET imaging to quantify AuNR distribution in major organs over time. The elimination half-life was negatively correlated with the volume of AuNR, while the net trans-endothelium kinetics was independent of the size of AuNR. The study found that smaller size and higher aspect ratio AuNRs potentially provide higher retention in the tumor, making them the best option for efficient EPR-mediated tumor delivery. The study highlights the importance of in vivo studies to understand the mechanism present in biological systems.The study investigated the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNR) in mice with U87MG tumors. The tumor retention of AuNR was related to the aspect ratio of AuNR, with smaller AuNRs being cleared faster from the liver and spleen over time. The ideal candidate for EPR-mediated tumor delivery was suggested to be AuNRs with a relatively small volume and high aspect ratio. The study provides tools for designing more efficient AuNR-based drug delivery platforms. The synthesis of Cu-64 labeled gold nanorods and the method of synthesizing gold nanorods are also described. All experiments with live animals were conducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Animal Care and Use Committee.Gold nanorods (AuNRs) were synthesized using CTAB and AgNO3 solution, HAuCl4, ascorbic acid, and gold seed solution. The aspect ratio of AuNR was adjusted by tuning the volume of AgNO3. The AuNRs were surface modified with SH-PEG-NH2. 64Cu-labeled AuNRs were prepared by adding 15 L 64CuCl2 to 200 mL of AuNR and shaking at 37 C for 1 h. The labeling efficiency was nearly 100%. Cytotoxicity study of AuNRs with five different sizes was conducted using U87MG human glioblastoma cells.The experiment involved adding MTT solution to cells in a plate and incubating it for 3 hours. The absorbance was recorded to calculate cell viability. The article discusses a theoretical model of diffusion of nanorods, including the Brownian movement and the diffusion coefficient. The article also discusses the margination of nanorods towards the vessel wall, which is a result of Brownian motion.The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNR) of different sizes in tumor-bearing mice using in vivo PET imaging. The margination of AuNR was theoretically supposed to be inversely proportional to the volume of AuNR. Five mice were used for each size of AuNR, and sequential PET scans were performed at different time points post-injection. The region of interest (ROI) of heart, tumor, liver, and spleen were drawn on the reconstructed PET images, and the time-activity curves (TAC) were generated by plotting the 64Cu-AuNR uptake as a function of time. The individual TACs within each group of AuNR size were averaged to have the mean TAC for each size of AuNR.The study investigated the effect of AuNR size on blood circulation and tumor accumulation kinetics in vivo using sequential static PET. Blood and tumor TACs were generated, and the blood elimination rate was calculated using a bi-exponential function. The transportation kinetics of 64Cu-AuNR from tumor vessel to tumor extravascular space through EPR effect was assessed by a two-compartment model. The signal intensity measured in a given tumor ROI on PET images is a weighted sum of Cp(t) and Cd(t). The K1, k2 values were calculated by fitting the measured TAC with the analytical ROI function CROI(t) using non-linear least-square regression. The volume of distribution in tumor interstitial space VD at equilibrium was defined, and the total residence time of 64Cu-AuNR in tumor during the 48 h post injection was studied.The biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled gold nanorods (AuNR) was studied in mice with tumors. PET imaging was used to measure the plasma input and tumor ROI time-activity curves (TAC). Compartmental modeling was conducted using a Matlab toolbox with input parameters of TAC data and initial guesses for K1, k2, wp, and wd values. Mice were sacrificed at 48 hours post-injection, and major organs and tumors were collected and measured for 64Cu content. CD31 immunostaining was performed to evaluate tumor vascular density, and Evans blue extraction was used to evaluate tumor vascular permeability.The article describes a study on the biodistribution of gold nanorods (AuNRs) in mice. The uptake of AuNRs in different tissues was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and the kinetics parameters K1 and k2 were calculated. The concentration of Evans blue in the supernatant was measured to determine the amount of AuNRs in the liver and spleen. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the tissue uptake of different sized AuNRs at different time points. The correlation between different groups of values was evaluated with Pearson correlation. Supplementary tables and figures are available.The article discusses the principles of nanoparticle design for drug delivery, including considerations for overcoming biological barriers and tumor targeting. It also covers the analysis of nanoparticle delivery to tumors and the use of gold nanoparticles for cancer therapy. The impact of nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry on biological systems is investigated, as well as the use of PEGylation as a strategy for improving nanoparticle-based drug and gene delivery. The article also includes a study on the clearance pathways and tumor targeting of imaging nanoparticles.The article discusses the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles after intravenous administration, with particle size and surface charge affecting the distribution.

The article concludes with a brief mention of recent advances in analytical and bioanalysis applications of noble metal nanorods.The article discusses the biodistribution of different sized nanoparticles, including copper oxide nanorods and gold nanoparticles, using positron emission tomography and mathematical modeling. The shape of the particles is also considered, with a focus on enhancing vascular interaction in laminar flows. The article concludes that particle size and shape have a significant impact on biodistribution and tissue morphology.The article discusses the influence of geometry and surface characteristics of gold nanoparticles on their biodistribution and uptake by macrophages. The experiment involved the preparation of five different gold nanorods (AuNRs) with varying aspect ratios and sizes. The study used a reversible two-compartment model to investigate the kinetics of AuNRs between plasma and tumor extravascular space during enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) mediated tumor delivery. The article also includes TEM images and UV-vis absorption spectra of the five AuNRs.The article presents the results of a study on the biodistribution of different sized gold nanorods (AuNRs) in mice. The activity curves of the mean uptake of 64Cu-AuNR in the heart, tumor, liver, and spleen were derived from PET images. The correlation between blood elimination half-life and the volume of AuNR was observed. The aspect ratio of AuNR was correlated with the tumor AUC, tumor uptake at 24 h and 48 h post-injection. The volume of AuNR was correlated with trans-endothelium kinetics constant K1 and volume of distribution VD. The study also included microscopic images of CD31 staining and quantification of CD31 count, Evans blue extraction, and tumor uptake. The sizes of the five AuNRs used in the study and different kinetics parameters calculated from compartmental modeling for each sized AuNR were presented in tables.The biodistribution of nanomaterials was studied in mice. At 48 hours, the maximum uptake (%ID/g) and K1 (h-1) and k2 (h-1) values were measured for five different types of nanomaterials (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5). The mean values for these parameters were also calculated. Additionally, the VDP1 value was measured for each type of nanomaterial. The experiment was repeated with P4 and P5 nanomaterials, and the same parameters were measured. Finally, the experiment was repeated with P2 and P3 nanomaterials, and the same parameters were measured. The mean and standard deviation values for each parameter were calculated for each group of nanomaterials.\n",

      "The article discusses the in vivo behavior and toxicology of nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) in mice after intravenous injection. The study investigates the influence of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on the distribution and toxicity of the NGO. The results show that NGO is mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen, with retention in the lung partially due to NGO aggregation. The PEG coating reduces the retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen and promotes the clearance of NGO from these organs. However, NGO and NGO-PEG are still present after 3 months. The PEG coating effectively reduces the early weight loss caused by NGO and alleviates NGO-induced toxicity.The article discusses the biodistribution and toxicity of nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating. NGO is a promising biomaterial for biomedical applications due to its unique properties. However, its in vivo distribution and toxicity have not been well studied. PEG is commonly used to increase the solubility and prolong the blood half-life of nanoparticles. The study investigates the in vivo behavior of NGO in mice after intravenous injection using 125I radioisotope tracing. The toxicology of NGO is determined using an evaluation system that includes the assessment of body weight, a blood biochemistry analysis, and a histopathological examination. The study aims to provide important supporting information to determine the feasibility of NGO for potential biomedical applications.The article describes an experiment that examines the influence of PEG coating on the distribution and toxicity of NGO. The experiment involved the synthesis and characterization of NGO and 125I-NGO, which were then coated with PEG6000. The PEG-modified NGO was designated as NGO-PEG or 125I-NGO-PEG, respectively. The biodistribution of the coated and uncoated nanoparticles was examined using mice as the test subjects. The experiment involved the use of carrier-free Na125I, chloramine-T, and other chemicals. The nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The radiochemical purity and stability of 125I-NGO was also examined.The article describes an experiment to determine the biodistribution of two types of nanomaterials, NGO and NGO-PEG, in mice. The nanomaterials were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis and dynamic light scattering. 80 mice were divided into 16 groups and injected with either 125I-NGO, 125I-NGO-PEG, or Na125I. The mice were sacrificed at different time points and their blood and various organs were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. The distribution of the injected sample in the blood and in each organ was represented as the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue. The study was conducted in compliance with national guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals and approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics.The biodistribution and toxicity of nanographene oxide (NGO) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified NGO were evaluated in mice. The blood concentrations of NGO and NGO-PEG were measured at different time points after intravenous injection. The blood circulation half-lives of 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG were calculated. Sixty mice were randomly assigned to three groups and injected with Milli-Q water, 5 mg/kg NGO, or 5 mg/kg NGO-PEG. The mice were sacrificed at different time points, and their body weight, blood biochemical parameters, and histopathological examination were evaluated. The major organs, including the liver, lung, and spleen, were excised and examined by optical microscopy. The study found that NGO-PEG had a longer blood circulation half-life and lower toxicity compared to NGO.The article describes the biodistribution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated nanographene oxide (NGO) in mice. The NGO was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The PEG coating was confirmed using thermal gravimetric analysis, and the amount of PEG coating was determined to be approximately 5.8%. The average sizes of NGO and NGO-PEG were measured using dynamic light scattering. The biodistribution of 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG was studied in mice, and it was found that PEG coating increased the blood circulation time and decreased the accumulation in the liver and spleen. The study suggests that PEG-coated NGO has potential as a drug delivery system.The article investigates the in vivo behavior of NGO (nanographene oxide) and NGO-PEG (nanographene oxide coated with polyethylene glycol) in mice. The zeta potential of NGO and NGO-PEG was measured. NGO was labeled with 125I and injected intravenously into mice. The percentage of injected 125I-NGO in each organ was investigated at different time points. NGO was mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen. Histopathological observation showed that NGO sheets accumulated in the pulmonary vascular lumen. The influence of PEG coating on the in vivo distribution of NGO was also observed. The percentage of injected 125I-NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen was measured at different time points.The article investigates the effect of PEG coating on the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, clearance, and toxicity of NGO (nanographene oxide) in mice. The radioactivity of NGO-PEG in the liver, lung, and spleen was significantly lower than that of NGO, indicating that the PEG coating reduced the retention of NGO in these organs. The blood circulation half-life of NGO was prolonged by the PEG coating. The number of NGO aggregations in the liver, lung, and spleen from NGO-PEG-treated mice was significantly reduced compared with such aggregations in NGO-treated mice, indicating that the PEG coating promoted clearance of NGO from these organs. PEG significantly improved the NGO-induced weight loss. However, both NGO and NGO-PEG persisted after 3 months.The article investigates the biodistribution of nanographene oxide (NGO) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated NGO in mice. Blood biochemical analysis showed that NGO caused acute injury to the liver and kidney, while PEG coating reduced these indices back to normal levels. Histopathological analysis revealed that NGO caused acute lung injury and early hepatic injuries, which were alleviated by PEG coating. There were no obvious pathological changes in the spleen and kidneys of mice treated with either NGO or NGO-PEG after 24 hours. Chronic pathological changes in the liver and lung were assessed after 3 months, and NGO induced chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis.The article discusses the in vivo behavior and toxicity of nanographene oxide (NGO) in mice after intravenous injection. The influence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on the distribution and toxicity of NGO was also investigated. The results showed that NGO particles with a size range of 10-800 nm were mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen. Retention in the lung was partially due to NGO aggregation. PEG coating reduced the retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen, and promoted clearance of NGO from these organs, but NGO and NGO-PEG were still present after 3 months. Moreover, the PEG coating effectively reduced the early weight loss caused by NGO and alleviated NGO-induced acute tissue injuries, which can include damage to the liver, lung, and kidney, and chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis. The reticuloendothelial system or the MPS is responsible for the retention of nanoparticles in tissues or organs.The article discusses the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of NGO sheets with different sizes. Small NGO sheets can pass through the kidneys and be eliminated without toxicity, while large sheets may form aggregations and cause toxicity. PEG coating reduces retention of NGO in the liver, lung, and spleen, and increases blood concentration and circulation half-life. PEG coating also promotes clearance of NGO from organs, but long-term existence may occur due to the limited clearance ability of the organism. The study evaluated the influence of PEG coating on NGO toxicity using an assessment of body weight. The PEG coating was accomplished by absorption, which may reduce MPS uptake and formation of NGO aggregation.The article discusses the biodistribution and toxicity of nanographene oxide (NGO) in mice. A low dose of NGO (5 mg/kg) was used due to increased mortality at higher doses. NGO caused acute injury to tissues including the liver, lung, and kidney, and chronic hepatic and lung fibrosis. NGO was mainly retained in the liver, lung, and spleen, with acute and chronic toxicity, whereas the PEG coating reduced the retention of NGO and alleviated NGO-induced toxicity. The distribution of NGO appears to be closely related to its size and dispersion. The study concludes that NGO of different sizes and dispersions show various results in terms of biocompatibility and toxicity.The article discusses the use of graphene oxide (NGO) in biomedical applications. The study found that the physiochemical characteristics of NGO, such as size, dispersion, and oxidative states, affect its biodistribution and toxicity.

The article concludes that biological barriers and current strategies can modify nanoparticle bioavailability, and nanoparticle clearance is governed by Th1/Th2 immunity and strain background.The article investigates the biodistribution of nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) and the influence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on its distribution. The study was conducted on mice, and the distribution of NGO and NGO-PEG in organs such as the liver, lung, and spleen was evaluated after 24 hours and 3 months. Blood circulation curves of 125I-NGO and 125I-NGO-PEG were also analyzed. The study found that PEG coating influenced the biodistribution of NGO, and the coated NGO showed less accumulation in the liver and spleen. The study also evaluated the body weights and blood biochemistry of mice treated with NGO and NGO-PEG. The results showed that NGO-PEG had a lower toxicity profile than NGO.The article investigates the biodistribution of nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated NGO in mice. The study examines the acute, time-dependent, and chronic histopathological changes induced by NGO and NGO-PEG in major organs such as the liver and lung. The experiment involves treating mice with Milli-Q water, 5 mg/kg NGO, or 5 mg/kg NGO-PEG and sacrificing them after 24 hours, one week, one month, and three months. The histopathological changes are observed using hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. The study finds that NGO accumulates in major organs and induces histopathological changes, which are time and dose-dependent. PEG coating reduces the toxicity of NGO.\n",

      "The article discusses the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for targeted drug delivery in human glioblastoma bearing murine models. The MSNs were modified with polyethylene glycol, anti-VEGFR ligand VEGF121, and radioisotope 64Cu.

The VEGF121 ligand targets the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) which is involved in angiogenesis. Radiolabeled ligands such as VEGF121 have been successfully used for imaging tumors using PET and SPECT techniques. However, direct radiolabeling of targeting ligands can alter their pharmacokinetics and binding affinity. The VEGF121-conjugated MSN showed increased accumulation in U87MG tumors compared to non-targeted MSN. This nanoplatform has potential for future theranostic nanomedicine. The study was conducted by the National Institutes of Health in the United States.The article discusses the need for a multifunctional nanosystem that can target VEGFR for cancer imaging and therapy. Silica-based mesoporous nanoparticles (MSNs) are considered safe and have been studied as drug carriers due to their biocompatibility and large pore volumes. MSNs can overcome the insolubility issue of hydrophobic drugs and deliver large payloads. However, actively targeted drug delivery is still a challenge, and most studies have focused on passive tumor targeting. The article proposes using VEGFR targeting ligands, imaging moieties, and therapeutic agents together in one nanosystem for effective VEGFR targeted cancer imaging and therapy.The article proposes a nanoplatform for simultaneous PET imaging and in vivo drug delivery. The platform is based on surface-engineered mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) modified with amino groups, chelator, PEGylation, VEGF121 linkage, and radioisotope labeling. The drug used is sunitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the target is VEGFR. The efficacy of the platform was tested in human glioblastoma-bearing mice with high VEGFR expression.

The experiment involved injecting mice with fluorescein conjugated NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 or NOTA-MSN-PEG and measuring the radioactivity in the tissues using a -counter. The study also involved histological analysis of organs including U87MG tumor, liver, spleen, and muscle. For drug delivery studies, SUN loaded MSN-NH2 was then conjugated with NOTA, PEG, and VEGF121 to form NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121. The study found that NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 enhanced drug delivery in U87MG tumor-bearing mice. The results were presented as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).The article describes the synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a size of 80 nm and a high specific surface area of 238 m2/g. The MSNs were surface modified with amino groups and loaded with the hydrophobic drug sunitinib. The drug release profile showed negligible release of sunitinib over 2 weeks, with enhanced release rate observed at lower pH values. The MSNs were further modified with NOTA, PEGylation, and VEGF121-SH to yield NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121, which was radiolabeled with 64Cu to form 64Cu-NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of a nanoconjugate for in vivo PET imaging.

Radiolabeling with 64Cu was performed to yield the 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugate. The stability of NOTA-MSN-PEG5k-VEGF121 nanoconjugates was monitored over several weeks with no obvious aggregation observed. The radiolabeling elution profile showed that 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 eluted between 3.5 and 4.5 mL from the column.The article describes the biodistribution of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugates in mice. The stability of the nanoconjugates in whole mouse serum was investigated and found to be excellent. In vitro studies were conducted to assess the binding affinity and specificity of VEGF121 for VEGFR upon conjugation with MSN. The targeted group showed strong fluorescence signals when incubated with fluorescein conjugated MSN-PEG-VEGF121, whereas only background fluorescence was observed in the non-targeted group.The article discusses the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of VEGFR-targeted nanoconjugates for imaging malignant glioblastomas. In vitro studies showed specific binding of VEGF121 tagged MSN to VEGFR-positive HUVECs, with low nonspecific binding observed in VEGFR-negative 4T1 breast cancer cells. In vivo PET scans showed high accumulation of the nanoconjugates in the tumor region, with low uptake in other organs.

The nanomaterials were intravenously injected, and PET images were taken at different time points. The liver showed prominent uptake of both nanomaterials, which decreased gradually over time. The U87MG tumor showed rapid and specific accumulation of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121, indicating successful in vivo VEGFR targeting. The difference in U87MG tumor uptake between the targeted and non-targeted groups was statistically significant. Ex vivo biodistribution studies were also conducted.The article discusses the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of targeted and non-targeted nanoparticles in U87MG tumor. The targeted nanoparticles showed enhanced tumor uptake due to VEGFR specific binding, while the non-targeted nanoparticles showed minimum passive targeting efficacy.

The results show that VEGF121 conjugated MSN had a much higher and faster accumulation in the tumor model compared to QD-VEGF121.The biodistribution of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoparticles was studied in mice using PET imaging and immunofluorescence staining. The major clearance organs were the liver, kidney, and intestine, with tumor uptake still prominent. The nanoparticles cleared through both hepatobiliary and renal routes. The %ID/g values in all major organs remained similar for the non-targeted group, confirming the VEGFR specific tumor uptake of the nanoconjugates. The PET and biodistribution quantification data agreed well, supporting the validity of noninvasive serial PET scans and ROI analyses. Immunofluorescence staining studies confirmed the PET imaging results, showing excellent overlay of the red and green signals in the U87MG tumor of the targeted group.The article discusses the use of MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoparticles for drug delivery. The biodistribution of the nanoparticles was studied using PET imaging and ex vivo histological analysis. The results showed high uptake of the nanoparticles in the liver and spleen, but with nonspecific accumulation due to macrophage capture or other mechanisms. No significant uptake was observed in muscle tissue. The study also investigated the use of NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanocarriers for in vivo tumor targeted drug delivery, using SUN, a hydrophobic, anti-VEGFR small molecule drug, as a proof-of-concept. The study suggests that loading drugs into these nanocarriers can improve treatment efficacy and reduce toxicity to nontarget organs.The article describes the synthesis and biodistribution of NOTA-MSN(SUN)-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugates for targeted drug delivery. The nanoconjugates were injected into U87MG bearing mice and imaged using an IVIS Spectrum imaging system. The accumulation of the drug in the tumor was higher in the targeted group compared to the non-targeted group. The negative control group showed only background levels of fluorescence in all organs. The accumulation in RES organs, such as liver and spleen, appeared low, contrary to the PET imaging results. Optical imaging cannot reliably measure the accurate absolute uptake of MSN(SUN) in different organs. However, it can serve as a handy tool to compare the drug uptake in U87MG tumors from the targeted and non-targeted groups.The article discusses the design, synthesis, and characterization of VEGFR targeted mesoporous silica nanostructures for enhanced drug delivery. In vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies confirmed the stability and VEGFR specific targeting ability of 64Cu-NOTA-MSN-PEG-VEGF121 nanoconjugates. In vivo PET imaging studies indicated an almost 3-fold enhancement in the tumor accumulation of targeted MSNs when compared to the non-targeted group, while the uptake in the other organs remained similar.

      "The article discusses the use of hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) for cancer imaging and therapy. The study aimed to develop an efficient in vivo targeting strategy and surface engineering techniques for HMSN to achieve active tumor targeting, quantitative tumor uptake assessment, multimodality imaging, biodistribution, and enhanced drug delivery. The study found that HMSN with a surface modified with a tumor-targeting peptide showed enhanced tumor accumulation and retention, as well as prolonged blood circulation time. The biodistribution study showed that the HMSN accumulated mainly in the liver and spleen, with a small amount in the tumor. The study suggests that HMSN has potential as a nano-platform for cancer imaging and therapy.The article discusses the use of a surface engineering technique to enhance the drug delivery of hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) for cancer theranostics. The study involved in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the stability, tumor targeting efficacy and specificity, biodistribution, and drug delivery capability of well-functionalized HMSN nano-conjugates. The highest uptake of TRC105 conjugated HMSN in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model was ~10%ID/g, 3 times higher than that of the non-targeted group. The article also mentions the potential of HMSN as a nano-platform for cancer imaging and therapy, with various types of inorganic functional nanocrystals integrated into the system for imaging and therapeutic applications.The article discusses the challenges of using hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) for in vivo targeted imaging and drug delivery. The authors report the first example of in vivo tumor targeting and enhanced drug delivery of TRC105 antibody conjugated MSN, which demonstrated promising potential in applying tumor vasculature targeting strategy to functionalized nanoparticles for possible better therapeutic outcome. However, the drug loading capacity of MSN needs to be further improved and the highest tumor uptake was not ideal. The authors report the in vivo tumor targeted positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dual-modality imaging and enhanced drug delivery of HMSN by using a generally applicable surface engineering method. The anti-cancer drug loading capacity of HMSN was found to be 315 times higher than previously reported MSN. By using CD105 based tumor vasculature targeting strategy, the authors achieved over 3-fold higher tumor uptake in targeted group when compared with the non-targeted group.

The HMSN had a pore size of 2-3nm, a hollow cavity diameter of ~100nm, and an MSN shell thickness of ~25nm. The surfactant CTAC was removed via an extraction process. The biodistribution of HMSN was studied in mice, and it was found that HMSN accumulated in the liver, spleen, and lungs, with minimal accumulation in other organs. The study suggests that HMSN could be used for cancer theranostics in the future.The article discusses the synthesis of hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) using selective etching of dSiO2 core and redeposition of soluble silicate species. Cationic surfactants, specifically CTAC, play a vital role in the etching-redeposition mechanism. The concentration of CTAC, etching temperature, and etching time should be tightly controlled to selectively etch out the dSiO2 core and leave the MSN shell intact. Surface engineering is important for in vivo applications of nanoparticles. The article also mentions the loading of small molecular anti-cancer drugs, near-infrared dye, and 64Cu-chelator inside the hollow space of HMSN.The article describes the synthesis of a stable nanoparticle conjugate for use in in vivo imaging. The conjugate was created by modifying a hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HMSN) with a PET isotope (64Cu), a near-infrared fluorophore (ZW800), and an anti-CD105 antibody (TRC105). The conjugate was PEGylated to increase stability and could be well-dispersed in phosphate buffered saline. The average size of the conjugate was ~150nm, and it had a slightly negatively charged surface. The article also notes that the ZW800 fluorophore has been shown to provide a better signal-to-background ratio than traditional dyes.The article describes the covalent conjugation of ZW800-NHS ester to the outer surface of HMSN-NH2 to enable nanoparticle NIRF imaging. The optimal ratio between HMSN and ZW800 was investigated to avoid dye-dye self-quenching, and a ratio of 1:2 was found to be optimal. In vitro studies were conducted to confirm the CD105 targeting efficiency of the HMSN-ZW800-TRC105, with flow cytometry results indicating that incubation with fluorescein conjugated HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 significantly enhanced the mean fluorescence intensity of HUVECs, while treatment with non-targeted groups or blocking groups only gave minimal fluorescence enhancement. The optimized ratio of 1:2 was used in subsequent in vivo tumor targeted imaging studies.The article discusses the successful targeting of CD105 using functionalized HMSN conjugates in vitro. In vivo tumor targeting and PET/NIRF dual-modality imaging were used to evaluate the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the conjugates. The nanoparticles were labeled with 64Cu for PET imaging, and serum stability studies showed high stability of the synthesized 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105. In vivo tumor targeted PET imaging was carried out in 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice, and serial PET scans were used to show the in vivo biodistribution patterns of mice from targeting.The article discusses the biodistribution of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105, a nanomaterial used for tumor targeting. The study found that the accumulation of the nanomaterial in the tumor was enhanced by the conjugation of TRC105, with a peak uptake of 9.9%ID/g at 4 hours post-injection. Blocking studies confirmed the specificity of the nanomaterial for CD105. The tumor-to-muscle ratios were also higher in the targeted group. However, the nanomaterial was also taken up by the liver and the reticuloendothelial system.The article discusses the use of hybrid mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) for in vivo imaging and drug delivery. The study involved the engineering of HMSN to integrate two or more imaging modalities into one nanosystem. The in vivo NIRF imaging was carried out on 4T1 tumor-bearing mice injected with HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 with 800pmol of ZW800. The results showed significantly higher optical intensity of the tumor from the targeted group. The biodistribution study showed that liver and spleen were the major nanoparticle uptake organs. The study concludes that HMSN has potential for enhanced in vivo tumor targeted drug delivery.The article discusses the use of TRC105 conjugated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) for enhanced drug delivery and tumor targeting efficacy. The study found that hollow cavity inside the MSN allowed for significantly improved drug loading capacity, up to 1129.2mg/g. The successful loading of the drug was confirmed by UV-vis absorbance spectra. The study also demonstrated that the MSN could be used for loading hydrophobic drugs and double-loading with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. In vivo experiments using TRC105 conjugated MSN showed enhanced tumor targeted drug delivery in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. The biodistribution of DOX was detected in major organs using the IVIS system.The article reports on the in vivo tumor vasculature targeted PET/NIRF dual-modal imaging of 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105. The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution of DOX in various tissues and the uptake level of injected HMSN(DOX)-(w/o)-TRC105. The results showed that although the liver is the dominant organ for HMSN nano-conjugates accumulation, only weak optical signal could be observed based on ex vivo optical imaging because of its dark color and strong absorbance of visible DOX fluorescence. In contrast, dominant optical signal from DOX could be observed in mice injected with HMSN(DOX)-TRC105 due to the much lighter color of tumor tissue. The CD105 specific targeting was further confirmed with blocking studies both in vitro and in vivo.The article reports on the engineering of uniform hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) for enhanced in vivo tumor vasculature targeted PET/NIRF dual-modality imaging and drug delivery. The HMSN were synthesized with a modified hard-templating method and subjected to surface engineering processes including amino group functionalization, anti-cancer drug loading, NIR dye and NOTA linkages, PEGylation, and antibody conjugation. The resulting 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 showed remarkable enhancement in targeting efficacy and tumor-to-muscle ratio compared to previously reported 64Cu-MSN-TRC105. The article also highlights the potential of TRC105 conjugated HMSN as a highly attractive drug delivery platform for future cancer theranostics.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of 64Cu-HMSN(DOX)-ZW800-TRC105 nano-conjugates for targeted cancer therapy. The optimal ratio of HMSN and ZW800 was found to be 1:2 with less than 5% quenching. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the stability, targeting efficacy, specificity, biodistribution, and drug delivery capability of the nano-conjugates. PET imaging showed over 3-fold higher tumor uptake in the targeted group compared to the non-targeted group. The presence of hollow space inside HMSN allowed for 315 times higher DOX loading capacity, with the highest loading capacity estimated to be 1129.2mg/g. In vivo enhanced DOX delivery was demonstrated in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.The article describes the synthesis of a nanomaterial called HMSN-NH2 and its conjugation with ZW800 and TRC105 for use in imaging and therapy. The synthesis involved the use of C, TEA, dSiO2, TEOS, and Na2CO3. The CTAC was removed using a NaCl solution. The HMSN-NH2 was functionalized with NH2 groups using APS. The conjugation of HMSN-NH2 with ZW800 and TRC105 involved the use of p-SCN-Bn-NOTA and SCM-PEG5k-Mal. The stability of the resulting products was tested in serum. The nanomaterials were labeled with 64CuCl2 for imaging purposes.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of a new type of nanomaterial, HMSN-ZW800-TRC105, for use in PET/NIRF imaging and biodistribution studies. The nanomaterial was labeled with 64Cu and purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile phase. Serum stability studies were conducted by incubating the nanomaterial in whole mouse serum at 37C for up to 24h. PET/NIRF imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted on tumor-bearing mice injected with 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800-TRC105 or 64Cu-HMSN-ZW800 via tail vein.

      "The article reports on an in vivo study of the safety, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics of laser-synthesized gold nanoparticles. The study was conducted on mice, and the results showed that the nanoparticles were well-tolerated and had a favorable biodistribution profile. The study also investigated the effect of particle size and surface coating on biodistribution and found that smaller particles and PEGylation led to increased accumulation in the liver and spleen. The authors conclude that laser-synthesized gold nanoparticles have potential for use in biomedical applications.The article discusses the use of laser-synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNP) coated with dextran for biomedical applications. The study examines the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety of intravenously administered AuNPd in small animal models. The results show that the AuNPd are rapidly eliminated from the blood circulation and accumulate in the liver and spleen without inducing toxicity. The study confirms that laser-synthesized AuNP are safe for biological systems, which promises their successful biomedical applications.Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have plasmonic effects that can be used for biomedical applications, particularly in oncology. AuNP can be targeted to tumors and used as contrast agents or sensitizers for local therapies. The absorption/scattering feature of Au nanostructures should be within the tissue transparency window of 700-1000nm. The toxicity of Au nanostructures depends on size, shape, surface conditioning, chemistry, and the presence of toxic contaminants.Conventional methods for synthesizing colloidal Au nanostructures can cause toxicity issues due to surface contamination by residual by-products, ligands, and reducing agents. Chemically-synthesized AuNP can be positively charged or stabilized by cationic surfactants, which can provoke undesirable interactions with negatively charged DNAs. The biocompatibility of chemically-synthesized Au nanostructures can be improved by coating them with polymers, but such coating cannot completely protect from the release of toxic agents after long-term exposure. The evolution of AuNP in biological systems is highly affected by a protein corona, which is strongly affected by initial surface conditioning and coatings. Spherical nanoparticles with a size around 15-50nm look less toxic, provided they do not contain toxic contaminants and are properly coated. Laser-ablative synthesis is a green physical alternative to conventional methods.The article discusses the synthesis of ultrapure gold nanoparticles (AuNP) using laser ablation in liquid ambient, which allows for control of size and structural characteristics. The resulting AuNP exhibit unusual surface chemistry based on the presence of gold oxide states, which enables hydrogen bonding interactions with biocompatible molecules. The one-step conjugation with polymers or other molecules presents an interesting new option for biological applications. The article also mentions studies on the interaction of laser-synthesized AuNP with rat pancreatic tumor cells, which showed non-toxicity and size-dependent cellular uptake.The article discusses the cytotoxicity and cell uptake of three types of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) - bare, dextran-coated, and PEG-coated. The study found that all types of AuNP demonstrated good cellular uptake and low toxicity. The article also examines the interaction of the nanoparticles with living cells and determines the composition of the protein corona covering the nanoparticles in a biological environment. The study also assesses the toxicity, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics of dextran-coated AuNP in a mouse model and finds that they are safe and do not provoke any toxic effects. The AuNP were synthesized using a technique of fs laser ablation in aqueous solutions.The article discusses the synthesis and stability of gold nanoparticles (AuNPd) prepared by femtosecond laser ablation in aqueous solutions. The AuNPd were found to be stable and had a mean size of 21nm. The effects of a single intravenous dose of 1mg/kg of AuNPd on body weight were investigated in mice, and no toxic effects were observed.The study involved administering 1mg/kg of AuNPd to mice and monitoring their growth and food and water consumption. The pharmacokinetic profile of AuNPd in blood was determined by injecting it into seven groups of mice and measuring gold concentration at different time intervals. The results showed a rapid drop in initial concentration, followed by a gradual decline fitting into a bi-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. More than 95% of the injected dose was eliminated from the blood circulation after one hour. No significant toxic effects were observed in the mice.The article discusses the biodistribution of AuNPd nanomaterials in mice. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicate a rapid clearance of AuNPd from the bloodstream, with a short half-life and high clearance value. The Vd parameter suggests that AuNPd accumulates in organs. The tissue biodistribution study shows that after 24 hours, the spleen and liver were the preferential sites for gold accumulation, with the liver accumulating the most.The biodistribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPd) was studied in mice after a single injection of 1mg/kg. The concentration of gold was measured in various organs and tumor at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days post-injection. The highest concentration of gold was found in the liver, with no significant decrease for 14 days. The concentration of gold in other organs and tumor was much lower, with the brain having the lowest concentration. AuNPd was not cleared by the kidney, with less than 0.1% of the injected dose found in urine. Histological examination of tissues did not reveal any negative effects or abnormalities.The study investigated the biodistribution and subcellular localization of AuNPd in hepatic and splenic tissues of mice. The results showed that AuNPd accumulated in liver and spleen, and were present inside phagocytosing cells of both organs. AuNPd were found to agglomerate in clusters and were localized in endolysosomal compartments without inducing cellular toxicity. No AuNPd was detected in other liver cells like hepatocytes or endothelial cells nor in lymphocytes and red blood cells in spleen. The study used a control group administered with vehicle alone.The article investigates the biodistribution of clustered AuNPd in animals and its effect on biochemical and inflammation parameters. The study found that although AuNPd accumulated in the liver and kidneys, they did not alter organ functionality. The study also found that there was a slight increase in creatinine levels in the group sacrificed 7 days after AuNPd injection, but it was transitory and did not suggest kidney dysfunction. The study did not observe any significant difference in the plasma level of interleukin-6, indicating that AuNPd did not have an inflammatory effect.The study investigated the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and toxicity of AuNP synthesized by ablation laser in dextran solution, following a bolus intravenous administration to subcutaneous tumor grafted mice. The results showed that a unique intravenous injection of 1mg/kg AuNPd was safe and did not induce acute and chronic toxicity. The AuNPd were promptly cleared from the bloodstream and accumulated preferentially in liver and spleen. Small quantities of gold were also present in kidney, lung, heart, and brain. The gold content in liver and spleen did not decrease over time, suggesting a poor clearing efficacy through the bile ducts. A very low amount of AuNPd was found in the kidney.The study investigated the biodistribution and safety of AuNPd (8nm) nanoparticles in mice. The nanoparticles accumulated in the liver, spleen, and kidney, but did not cause any hepatic or renal toxicity. Very low concentrations of gold were observed in cardiac and pulmonary tissues, indicating good tolerability. Less than 1% of gold was detectable in the brain, but no cognitive or compartmental abnormalities were detected in living animals. The study suggests that AuNPd can be useful for brain tumor treatment as a drug delivery vector or photothermotherapy after optimizing brain uptake.The article discusses the use of ultrasound to temporarily open the blood-brain barrier and the competition between passive targeting of nanoparticles to tumors and their clearance by phagocytic cells. The study found that gold nanoparticles were not detectable in tumors due to their short blood half-life, but increasing the quantity of dextran or using polyethylene glycol as a surfactant could increase accumulation in tumors. The article also mentions that the observed toxicity of the nanoparticles was low compared to previous studies, but residual accumulation of gold in the organism was still present.The article discusses the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution of laser-synthesized dextran-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNP) in small animal models. The study found that AuNP accumulated mostly in the liver and spleen but did not cause any hepatic or renal toxicity. The article also compares the toxicity of AuNP to silica nanoparticles and bare silicon nanoparticles, which were rapidly biodegraded and eliminated from the organism. The study suggests that AuNP can be eliminated from the organism if their size is within renal glomerular filtration range.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of dextran-coated gold nanoparticles using a Yb:KGW laser. The nanoparticles were found to be safe and promising for biomedical applications. In vivo studies were conducted on 24 athymic nude female mice to determine the biodistribution of the nanoparticles. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and housed in controlled conditions. On day 0, the mice were injected with 2.5x10^6 U of nanoparticles and their tissues were analyzed for nanoparticle accumulation. The experimental protocols and animal analyses were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the French Government and the Regional Committee for Ethics on Animal Experiments.The experiment involved administering 87-MG human glioblastoma cells subcutaneously on the left flank of mice. On day 14, when the tumor measured approximately 100mm3, three groups of six mice were intravenously administered with a single dose of 1mg/kg dextran-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPd) diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Control mice were injected with PBS. The mice were monitored for body weight and behavior, and were sacrificed at different times after AuNPd injection. The organs were removed and processed for histological and electron microscopy analysis. For the pharmacokinetic study, 35 athymic nude female mice were used and randomly divided into 7 groups. The mice were administered intravenously with the maximal dose of 1mg/kg AuNPd and were sacrificed at different time points. Blood samples were collected for gold determination analysis.The study aimed to determine the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in mice. Tumor tissues, blood, and urine samples were collected and mineralized with nitric acid/hydrochloric acid. The mineralized pellets were analyzed using ICP-MS to determine Au concentration. Biochemical analysis was performed on blood samples to quantify ALAT, ASAT, creatinine, and interleukin-6 plasmatic levels. Histological analysis was conducted on organs collected, fixed, and conserved in formalin solution before paraffin-embedding. The stained slides were scanned on a whole slide scanner.The study investigated the biodistribution of nanomaterials in mice. Three mice per group were perfused with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, and their organs were collected and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The samples were fixed, washed, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut and viewed with a FEI Tecnai G2 electron microscope.

      "The article presents a study on the behavior of biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) designed to carry multiple cargos and self-destruct following the release of their payloads. The bMSNs are intrinsically radiolabeled with oxophilic zirconium89 (89Zr) radionuclide to track their in vivo pharmacokinetics via positron emission tomography imaging. The study successfully demonstrates rapid and persistent CD105 specific tumor vasculature targeting in a murine model of metastatic breast cancer using TRC105 (an antiCD105 antibody). Complete degradation of bMSNs is seen within 21 days of incubation in simulated body fluid.The article discusses the use of biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) for nanomedicine. The study focuses on intrinsic radiolabeling and PET imaging to track the biodistribution of the nanoparticles. The article highlights the challenges facing nanomedicine and the need for safe and effective theranostic nanoparticles. The study concludes that the use of bMSNs is a promising approach for personalized nanotheranostics.The article discusses the need for nanocarriers for biomacromolecular drugs in cancer therapeutics. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are a promising option due to their large specific surface area and well-defined porous structure. However, their inefficient tumor targeting and rapid sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) have limited their clinical applications. The article proposes an improved design for silica nanoconjugates that can entrap large molecular drugs, self-destruct into small fragments, and facilitate clearance for better clinical translation.Dendritic, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (bMSNs) were synthesized with a centrally radiating, two-tiered porous network. The nanoparticles were designed to (1) load macromolecular cargo, (2) degrade over time, (3) accumulate in tumor tissues, and (4) be tracked over a long period of time using intrinsically labeled zirconium89 (89Zr) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The bMSNs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The nanoparticles were found to be monodispersed, with a diameter of 162.9 nm, a hydrodynamic diameter of 190.1 nm, and a concentration of 8.97 x 10^11 nanoparticles/mL or 3.59 x 10^14 g^-1.The article describes the physicochemical characterization of bMSNs, including their size, surface area, and pore size distribution. The concentration of silanol groups was estimated to be 1 107 per nanoparticle. The article also mentions a simplified one-pot synthetic protocol for tailoring the pore size of bMSNs. The degradation study of silica nanoparticles is briefly mentioned but not elaborated on.The biodistribution of nanoparticles larger than 10 nm is challenging due to their prolonged residence in non-targeted organs. Self-destructing silica nanoparticles can be a promising platform for in vivo imaging and drug delivery. The degradation of as-synthesized nanoparticles was tested by incubating them in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37°C for 21 days with constant stirring. The pH of the soaking solution was tuned to 4.5 to mimic the natural lysosomal environment. The degradation accelerated over time, resulting in smaller and irregularly shaped nanoparticles and fragments. Only debris like silica fragments could be seen under the TEM by day 21.The article discusses the biodistribution of silica nanoparticles (SNs) with different structures and pore sizes. The study found that SNs with a radially arranged porous network (bMSNs) had a higher degradation rate compared to solid or dense silica nanoparticles (dSNs) and regular mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a smaller pore size. The higher surface area and lower degree of crosslinking of the silicate skeleton in bMSNs were attributed to the faster degradation rate. The study also analyzed the release of Si ions and labeled SNs in mouse serum.The article discusses the degradation of silica nanoparticles (SNs) and how their hierarchical porous structure and larger pore diameter enhance their degradability. The degradation process is expected to be more rapid in vivo, aided by lysosomal enzymes. The article also emphasizes the importance of controlling the degradation time and rate for designing a clinically relevant nanovehicle. The article briefly mentions cargo loading and release using MSNs as an ideal platform for combination chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to tailor the nanoparticle design and functionalization for developing an ideal drug delivery vehicle.The study evaluated the effect of pore size and structure on cargo loading capacity of synthesized SNs. The loading capacity of small molecule, hydrophobic antiangiogenesis drug (SUN) was tested in SNs suspended in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. MSNs and bMSNs demonstrated high loading capacity, with up to 155.09 and 295.95 mg SUN loaded per g of nanoparticles, respectively. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein to demonstrate the dual loading capacity of SNs. The effect of pore size on protein encapsulation was apparent, with 589.28 mg of BSA encapsulated per g of bMSNs while only 250.0 mg could be loaded per g of MSN.The study investigated the release of small molecule drug (SUN) and larger protein (BSA) from bMSNs and MSNs at 37°C in SBF (pH 5.0) to mimic the tumor microenvironment. The release profiles of SUN and BSA from bMSNs and MSNs were different due to the differences in their mesostructures. bMSNs showed a multistage release for both SUN and BSA, with slow and steady release up to 24 h followed by a sharp spike around day 3. The degradability of bMSNs played an important role in enhanced release of the loaded cargo. Cumulative release of encapsulated drugs was found to be higher for bMSN than MSN.The article discusses the use of degradable silica nanostructures for drug delivery. The nanostructures have a slower release profile, which prevents premature shedding of cargo and minimizes off-target toxicity. The larger pores of the nanostructures also enhance the therapeutic index of drugs. The article also describes a novel application of mesoporous silica nanomaterials in intrinsic chelation of specific oxophilic radionuclides such as 89Zr, which can potentially overcome the problems associated with chelator instability and tedious chemistries for chelator functionalization. The silica nanoparticles were radiolabeled with 89Zr for in vivo tracking of nanoparticles.The article discusses the labeling and stability of three types of nanomaterials (bMSNs, MSNs, and dSNs) with 89Zr for in vivo applications. The bMSNs and MSNs showed high labeling yields and stability in serum, while dSNs showed poorer stability. The high surface area of bMSNs allowed for more stable chelation of 89Zr. The bMSNs were subsequently functionalized for in vivo studies.The article describes the synthesis of a nanomaterial, [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, for in vivo studies. The nanomaterial was synthesized through a step-by-step process involving modification with NH2 groups, direct chelator-free labeling with oxophilic 89Zr, and PEGylation twice. The final nanoconstructs were obtained by conjugating TRC105SH to the PEGylated samples. The article also discusses the importance of effective PEGylation for longer circulation of nanoparticles and tumor targeting ability conferred to the nanoconjugates by attachment of an antiCD105 antibody.The article discusses the conjugation of TRC105 to [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kMal and its effect on in vivo biodistribution and targeting efficacy. The optimal protocol was found to depend on the reaction ratio, incubation time, and the number of reactive thiol groups on each antibody. The number of TRC105 molecules attached to each bMSN was calculated to be about 44 for effective active targeting. The ligand density was shown to affect nanoparticle-receptor/antigen interactions. The zeta potential values confirmed the success of each step of the conjugation protocol. The near-neutral zeta potential of the nanoconjugates is advantageous for longer circulation in the blood. The article also discusses in vivo biodistribution and tumor vasculature targeting with [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, which targets the CD105 or endoglin receptor highly overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial cells.The study aimed to assess the CD105 targeting of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105, a nanoconjugate, in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Rapid and persistent uptake of nanoparticles was observed in the targeted group, while the control nontargeted and blocking groups showed only minimal accumulation in the tumors. CD105 targeting was responsible for the excellent and specific tumor uptake of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105. The administration of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 resulted in greater tumor contrast and more rapid detection.The study evaluated the biodistribution of targeted and non-targeted bMSNs in mice using [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k nanoconjugates. The targeted group showed higher tumor uptake and contrast index values compared to the non-targeted group. The elimination half-life of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 was estimated to be 4.6 hours. The nanoconjugates were mainly sequestered by the RES organs, such as the liver and spleen. The study suggests the potential of [89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 in cancer theranostics.The biodistribution of bMSNs was studied in mice using PET scans and ex vivo analysis up to day 7. The signal from the joints increased at later time points, likely due to chelation by hydroxylapatite. The osteal accumulation of 89Zr increased persistently with time, possibly due to the degradation of the bMSN skeleton and transmetalation of 89Zr by intrinsic chelators or plasma proteins. The increase in radioactivity in the joints was accompanied by a decline in the %ID g1 values in the liver after day 3, likely due to the excretion of bMSNs and their fragments. CD105 specific uptake of the nanoconjugates was confirmed through histological analyses.The study reports the first systematic in vivo study of intrinsically 89Zr-labeled bMSNs, targeted for CD105 marker specificity in murine metastatic breast cancer model. The nanoparticles were found to be largely distributed on the vasculature with minor extravasation. The liver and spleen tissues show high accumulation of the nanoparticles, but the uptake is largely nonspecific. The muscle tissue does not emit any fluorescence signal. The study demonstrates excellent CD105 specificity, which was confirmed by extensive in vivo and ex vivo testing. Vascular targeting exhibited greater than threefold enhancement in absolute tumor uptake and normal tissue contrast.The article discusses a method to create self-destructing angiogenesis targeted nanoplatforms using silica nanoparticles. The nanoparticles can be modified to label diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes, carry small and large biomolecular drugs, target multiple tumor types, and self-destruct for excretion from the body. The experiment involved synthesizing biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles with radially arranged mesochannels using a biphase stratification method. The materials used in the experiment were TRC105, NHS fluorescein, Chelex 100 resin, TEOS, triethanolamine, APS, CTAC, cyclohexane, BSA, AlexaFluor488, Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies, PD10 columns, absolute ethanol, sodium chloride, SUN, and SCMPEG5kMal. The aqueous solution was pretreated with Chelex 100 resin to ensure it was free of heavy metals.The article describes the synthesis and characterization of three types of silica nanoparticles: bMSNs, MSNs, and dSNs. The bMSNs were synthesized by mixing CTAC, TEA, and TEOS in water, followed by centrifugation and removal of the CTAC template. The MSNs were synthesized by mixing CTAC, TEA, and TEOS in water, followed by centrifugation and removal of the CTAC template. The dSNs were synthesized using a modified Stber method. The nanoparticles were characterized using TEM, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, DLS, and zeta potential analysis.Silica nanoparticles were modified with amine groups to facilitate surface conjugations. In vitro degradation behaviors were studied by incubating equal amounts of all three types of silica nanoparticles in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The concentration of released Si ions was determined using MPAES analysis. Small molecule anticancer drug SUN and macromolecular protein BSA were used as model therapeutic agents to demonstrate dual cargo encapsulation efficacy of silica nanoparticles. SUN loading was carried out by dispersing equal amounts of silica nanoparticles in a 2 mg/mL solution of SUN in DMSO.The article describes a study on the biodistribution of nanomaterials. The loading efficacy and capacity of the nanomaterials were determined by adding them to a BSA solution and quantifying the supernatant. The release study was carried out by suspending the nanomaterials in a solution and periodically testing for released substances. The nanomaterials were labeled with 89Zr using chelator-free labeling and their in vitro serum stability was evaluated. The specific procedures and parameters used in the experiment are detailed.The study involved the synthesis of a targeted imaging agent using thiolated TRC105 antibody conjugated to bMSNs. The biodistribution of the agent was studied in 4T1 breast cancer cells in Balb/c mice using in vivo vasculature targeted PET imaging. The agent was purified using a 100 kDa centrifugal filter, and radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter. The study was conducted per the approved protocol of the University.The biodistribution of two types of nanomaterials ([89Zr]bMSNPEG5kTRC105 and [89Zr]bMSNPEG5k) was studied in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. PET scans were performed at various timepoints, and ex vivo biodistribution studies were carried out after the final PET scans at 48 h p.i. Histological analysis of major tissues was also conducted. The contrast enhancement was calculated in terms of two parameters: Tumor-to-muscle ratio (T/M) and Contrast index (CI). The mice in the blocking group were each injected with unlabeled TRC105 antibody.The article discusses the use of a rat antimouse CD31 antibody and a Cy3-labeled donkey antirat IgG to study the biodistribution of nanomaterials in rats.

      "The article discusses the use of chelator-free zirconium-89 (89Zr) labeling of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) for in vivo imaging. The study found that successful radio-labeling and in vivo stability are dependent on the concentration and location of deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) from two types of silica nanoparticles investigated. The 89Zr-labeled MSN showed significantly enhanced in vivo long-term stability for up to 20 days. The article suggests that chelator-free 89Zr-MSN offers a novel, simple, and accurate way for studying the in vivo long-term fate and PET image-guided drug delivery of MSN in the near future.Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to study the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of radio-labeled nanoparticles in live animals. Chelator-based radio-labeling is the most widely used technique for synthesizing radio-labeled nanoparticles. Various chelators such as NOTA and DOTA have been used to label carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), and porous silica nanoparticles for tumor-targeted cancer imaging and biodistribution studies. However, concerns about the in vivo integrity of radio-labeled nanoparticles have been raised due to potential detachment of radio-isotopes from nanoparticles, leading to erroneous interpretation of PET imaging results. To address these concerns, there is an emerging concept of synthesizing intrinsica.The article discusses the synthesis of intrinsically radio-labeled nanoparticles for more accurate investigation of their biodistribution in vivo. Various combinations of radio-isotopes and nanoparticles have been reported, including 64Cu-labeled porphysome, arsenic-72 and germanium-69-labeled SPION, [64Cu]CuS nanoparticles, 18F-labeled upconversion nanoparticles, and hydroxyapatite. Zirconium-89 is a radio-isotope suitable for long blood circulating monoclonal antibody-based PET imaging, but significant bone uptake was observed for various 89Zr-DFO-mAb studies within 7 days postinjection, indicating limited stability of DFO-based 89Zr labeling. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles with abundant silanol groups on the silica surface have been considered for potential radio-labeling.The article discusses the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) for stable radio-labeling of 89Zr. The authors hypothesize that deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) inside the meso-channels or on the surface of MSN could function as inherent hard oxygen donors for stable radio-labeling of 89Zr. The study demonstrates a significantly enhanced stability of 89Zr-MSN in mice over 3 weeks. The article provides a chelator-free labeling mechanism for mesoporous silica nanoparticles to study their long-term in vivo stability and fate. The MSN was synthesized and characterized, and the presence of radial meso-channels throughout each MSN was confirmed. The BET surface area was measured to be 581.5 m2/g, with a high pore volume of 1.3 cm3/g.The article discusses the labeling of 89Zr4+ to the deprotonated silanol groups (SiO) from the outer surface and inner meso-channels of MSN. The study estimates that there are about 23 million SiOH groups in each MSN particle, with nearly all of the SiOH groups expected to be inside the meso-channels but not on MSNs outer surface. The article also shows that about 70% 89Zr labeling yield was achieved for MSN within the first 15 min of incubation, and the yield continued to increase over time and reached 82.5% at 2 h post-incubation. The study further demonstrated that there was no significant reduction (less than 5%) of drug loading capacity.The article discusses the chelator-free labeling of 89Zr to mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) and the role of deprotonated silanol groups in this process. The pH value of MSN was adjusted to 23 to ensure protonation of silanol groups, which significantly reduced the 89Zr labeling yield. The study also investigated the effect of the location and concentration of deprotonated silanol groups on the 89Zr labeling yield and stability using amorphous dSiO2 as a control. The results showed that deprotonated silanol groups play a vital role in chelator-free labeling of 89Zr to MSN. The study provides a schematic illustration of the labeling of 89Zr4+ to the deprotonated silanol groups from the outer surface of dSiO2.The article discusses the stability and biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled silica nanoparticles (89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2) in vitro and in vivo. The authors found that both nanoparticles showed high stability in vitro when challenged with DFO or EDTA, with over 96% 89Zr retained in MSN. In vivo studies showed that both nanoparticles had similar long-term stabilities and biodistribution patterns, with accumulation in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The authors suggest that these nanoparticles have potential for use in imaging and drug delivery applications.The article discusses the use of PET imaging to monitor the biodistribution, biodegradation, clearance pathway, and rate of nanoparticles in vivo. The challenge is to develop an optimal chelator for 89Zr labeling. In vitro studies suggested high stability of 89Zr in both MSN and dSiO2, but their ultimate stability needs to be tested in vivo for a long period of time. Healthy BALB/c mice were injected with 89Zr-MSN or 89Zr-dSiO2 and monitored for 3 weeks. The change of bone uptake was monitored to study the in vivo stability of 89Zr-labeled nanoparticles. MSN with a larger pore size has a faster biodegradation rate, so 90 nm sized MSN with a high surface area and 910 nm pore size were used in the in vivo stability study. Normal dSiO2 with a similar particle size served as the control group.The article discusses the biodistribution of 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSN in mice after intravenous injection. TEM images showed no significant morphology change after 89Zr labeling. The maximum intensity projection images showed dominant liver and spleen uptake with no obvious bone uptake within 3 h p.i. in both cases. Mice injected with 89Zr-dSiO2 showed significant bone uptake from day 1 p.i., indicating that the exposed 89Zr from the dSiO2 surface can be vulnerable to attack by the endogenous (protein) ligands. Mice injected with 89Zr-MSN showed an extremely high in vivo stability throughout 3 weeks, with less than 1 %ID/g uptake in bone on day 7 p.i.The article discusses the stability and biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) in mice. The meso-channels of MSN protect 89Zr from endogenous chelators, resulting in slower detachment rates compared to dSiO2. The ROI quantification shows an increased liver uptake of 89Zr-MSN from 29.7 4.8 %ID/g at 0.5 h p.i. to 39.5 4.5 %ID/g on day 7 p.i. The hepatic clearance of 89Zr-MSN was observed with a gradual decrease in liver uptake to 34.2 3.3 %ID/g on day 21 p.i. The article suggests that the high stability of 89Zr-labeled MSN could open up a new possibility for studying the long-term fate of MSN-based nanoparticles in live animals.The biodistribution of 89Zr-MSN and 89Zr-dSiO2 nanoparticles was studied in mice, with dominant liver/spleen uptake and higher bone uptake of free 89Zr detached from the dSiO2 surface. Renal clearance of porous silicon was observed, but neither bladder nor kidney uptake of 89Zr-MSN fragments was observed. Suitable surface functionalization is needed before bare silica nanoparticles can be considered as drug delivery systems. The use of intrinsic deprotonated silanol groups from MSN for chelator-free radio-labeling may be applicable to other oxophilic radio-metals. PEGylated MSN can only circulate in the blood for a short time.The article reports a chelator-free technique to label 89Zr to MSN. The labeling yield was concentration- and temperature-dependent. The detachment rate of 89Zr from MSNs meso-channels was found to be 20-fold slower than that of 89Zr from the dSiO2 surface in vivo. The article suggests that the technique can be used for systematic and long-term in vivo biodegradation and biodistribution tracking of MSN. The silica coating has been widely used in biomedical applications, and the labeling technique might be highly desirable for future clinical translation.The article describes a method for producing silica-based radio-labeled nanoparticles for theranostic applications. The 89Zr-oxalate is produced using a cyclotron and has a specific activity of 20 GBq/mol of Zr. Dense silica nanoparticles (dSiO2) and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) are synthesized using modified Stber and biphase stratification approaches, respectively. The dSiO2 nanoparticles are 90 nm in size and collected by centrifugation, washed with water/ethanol, and resuspended in water. The MSN nanoparticles are 150 nm in size with a 45 nm pore size and are collected by centrifugation and subjected to CTAC removal process.The article describes a method for labeling nanomaterials with 89Zr without the use of chelators. Two types of nanomaterials were used: mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) and dense silica nanoparticles (dSiO2). The labeling yield was monitored and quantified using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and radio-TLC. The stability of the labeled nanoparticles was tested by adding DFO-Bz-NCS and EDTA to the solution. The results showed that the 89Zr-labeled nanoparticles were stable and could be easily collected by centrifugation.The article describes the biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (89Zr-MSN) and 89Zr-labeled diatomaceous earth silica nanoparticles (89Zr-dSiO2) in mice. The in vitro serum stability of both nanoparticles was studied, and the drug loading capacity of MSN before and after 89Zr labeling was tested using doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as the model drug. In vivo PET imaging was performed on healthy BALB/c mice to monitor the biodistribution of the nanoparticles. Both free 89Zr and 89Zr-MSN were quantified at different time points using radio-TLC. The study provides information on the pharmacokinetics and potential applications of these nanoparticles in drug delivery and imaging.The article describes a study on the biodistribution of two types of nanomaterials, 89Zr-dSiO2 and 89Zr-MSN, in mice.

      "The article reports on a study that aimed to evaluate the acute toxicity of amorphous silica nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice. The lethal dose, 50 (LD50), of intravenously administrated SNPs was calculated in mice using Dixon's up-and-down method (262.45-33.78 mg/kg). The acute toxicity was evaluated at 14 d after intravenous injection of SNPs at 29.5, 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg in mice. A silicon content analysis using ICP-OES found that SNPs mainly distributed in the resident macrophages of the liver (10.24%ID/g), spleen (34.78%ID/g).The article discusses the biodistribution of amorphous silica nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice. The SNPs were found to accumulate primarily in the liver and lungs, with only a small amount in the kidneys. The mice treated with SNPs showed elevated levels of serum LDH, AST, and ALT, indicating liver damage. Histological examination revealed injuries in the liver, spleen, and lungs, with macrophage proliferation in the liver and spleen. The study was supported by various funding sources, but the funders had no role in the study design or analysis. The article highlights the potential hazards of SNPs and their widespread use in various industries and biomedical applications.The article discusses the urgent need to evaluate the toxicity of amorphous SNPs, which have been shown to induce cytotoxicity in vitro in a dose-, time-, size-, and cell line-dependent manner. SNPs can enter cells through different routes and cause oxidative stress and inflammation response, leading to cell membrane damage, DNA strand breaks, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell cycle arrest, necrosis, and apoptosis. In vivo toxicity of SNPs has been studied less than in vitro toxicity, with animal inhalation studies indicating pulmonary toxicity. Intravenous exposure to SNPs has become common in biomedicine and biotechnology, but little research has been carried out to assess its toxicity, and there is no uniform standard for determining the toxicity of nanomaterials entering the bloodstream.The article evaluates the acute toxicity of 64 nm silica nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice. The LD50 of SNPs in ICR mice was estimated using Dixon's up-and-down method. Dead animals were necropsied to identify the cause of death. A series of doses were set based on the LD50 for acute toxicity research. The silicon content of tissues was determined by ICP-OES. Blood biochemical assay, morphological and histopathological examination, and TEM imaging were used to investigate the adverse effects of SNPs on major organs.

Male and female ICR mice were used in the experiment.The article describes an experiment approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at Capital Medical University to estimate the LD50 of SNPs (silicon nanoparticles) using Dixon's Up-and-Down Method. Mortality was recorded and necropsies were performed. The silicon content in the tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain) was determined by analyzing samples digested with nitric acid using ICP-OES. Acute toxicity was studied by injecting SNPs in physiological saline at different doses to 40 mice of either sex, and symptoms and mortality were observed and recorded. Body weight and coefficients of organs were measured after exposure to the different doses of SNPs.In this experiment, mice were injected with nanomaterials and their biodistribution was studied. The mice were weighed on days 1 and 14, and on day 14, the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain were removed and weighed.

Megakaryocyte accumulation, increased size of red pulp in the spleen, and renal interstitium hyperemia were also observed.The article investigates the biodistribution and acute toxicity of silica nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice. The study found that SNPs mainly accumulated in the liver and spleen, but not in the lung. The silicon content varied in different tissues, with about 12.67% of the injected SNPs localized in the liver and 34.78% in the spleen, while only 1.96% localized in the lung. The study also found that SNPs caused acute toxicity in mice, with labored breathing, cyanosis, and difficulty in movement observed in the high-dose group. One male animal died, and seven mice developed progressive tail ischemic necrosis. The study suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the potential risks of SNPs.The article describes an experiment on the acute toxicity of SNPs (silver nanoparticles) in ICR mice. The mice were injected with different doses of SNPs and observed for 14 days. After the observation period, the mice were weighed and sacrificed, and their major organs were weighed and examined for coefficients. The weight gain decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the SNP treated mice, but with no significant difference compared to the control group. The coefficient of liver was obviously increased in the highest treated group, and the coefficient of spleen was significantly higher in the 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg treated groups than in the control group. The LDH and ALT levels were significantly higher in the treated groups than in the control group, indicating cell membrane injury and tissue damage in the treated mice.The article reports on the biodistribution and toxicity of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice. The SNPs were administered intravenously at doses of 29.5, 103.5, and 177.5 mg/kg. The study found that the SNPs accumulated in the liver, spleen, and lungs of the mice. The liver showed signs of toxicity, including lymphocytic infiltration, granuloma formation, and hydropic degeneration. Megakaryocyte hyperplasia was present in the spleen, and pulmonary hyperemia and interstitial thickening were observed in the lungs. However, there were no significant changes in the morphology of the heart, kidney, or brain. The study concludes that the SNPs have potential toxicity to the liver and lungs at high doses.The article presents a study on the biodistribution of silica nanoparticles (SNP) in mice. The study involved administering different doses of SNP to mice and analyzing the histological changes in various organs. The results showed that the number and size of granulomas in the liver increased in a dose-dependent manner. The number of megakaryocytes in the spleen also increased significantly in the SNP treated groups. The lung sections of the SNP treated mice revealed pulmonary interstitial thickening and pulmonary arterioles dilatation and congestion. Immunohistochemistry stain of CD68 showed that CD68 positive cells were mainly located in the hepatic sinusoid in the liver. The study suggests that SNP can cause pathological changes in various organs, and macrophages may play a role in these changes.The biodistribution of silica nanoparticles (SNPs) was studied in mice. The study found that CD68 positive cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in the liver, spleen, and lung of SNP treated mice. Hepatic granulomas showed strong positive signals for CD68 in the SNP treated mice. The number of CD68 positive cells in the liver and spleen was significantly greater in the SNP treated mice than in the control mice. In the lung, CD68 positive cells mainly localized in the pulmonary interstitial or the alveolar space in the control and 29.5 mg/kg treated mice. Positive signals for CD68 expression were also observed in suspected granuloma occasionally found in the lung sections of the 103.5 and 177.5 mg/kg treated mice.The article investigates the biodistribution of silica nanoparticles (SNPs) in major organs of mice. The study found that SNPs were observed in the resident macrophages in the liver, lung, and spleen. However, a limited amount of SNPs was found trapped in the hepatocytes in the liver, in the pulmonary capillary endothelial cells in the lung, or in the glomerulus capillary endothelial cells in the kidney. The SNPs found in the tissues appeared to aggregate into clumps, enveloped by a lysosomal membrane and without any obvious change of size or shape.

The results showed elevated biochemical indexes and histopathological changes in the liver, spleen, and lung. The study also revealed macrophage proliferation in the liver and spleen induced by SNPs. The study contributes to the evaluation of the safety of SNPs in biomedical and pharmacological applications.The study aimed to determine the LD50 value of 70 nm silver nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice using the Dixon up-and-down method. The intravenous injection of SNPs at 325.5 mg/kg was often lethal and caused hepatic necrosis, pulmonary microthrombi, hyperemia, and hemorrhage in the main organs of the dead mice. The study hypothesized that a large amount of SNPs in the bloodstream might induce platelet activation and aggregation, followed by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), wide microthrombus formation, multiple organ failure, and death. The subsequent biodistribution analysis of SNPs in the 177.5 mg/kg group revealed that the thrombogenicity of the SNPs should be taken into serious consideration in their biological and pharmacological application.The biodistribution of SNPs was studied after intravenous injection. The SNPs mainly accumulated in the liver, spleen, and lungs, with most of them being taken up by resident macrophages. The bioretention of SNPs lasted more than 4 weeks. However, after 14 days, almost 47.45% of the injected SNPs were distributed in the liver and spleen. The SNPs induced macrophage activation and proliferation in the liver and spleen, leading to injury in these organs. The presence of hepatic granuloma formation was observed, which is an innate immune response designed to isolate xenobiotics. Granuloma induced by nanomaterials through different routes have been reported.The biodistribution of SNPs (silver nanoparticles) was studied in mice after repeated intravenous administration. The liver and spleen were found to be the main organs for nanoparticle accumulation. The spleen showed histological hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in the red pulp, indicating splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis. The retention of SNPs in the spleen may impact the splenic immune function. The serum LDH, AST, and ALT levels were elevated in the SNP treated groups, indicating cell membrane destruction in the main organs. The toxicity and mechanism induced by SNPs in the hemopoietic system and the immune system need to be clarified.The study aimed to evaluate the acute toxicity and biodistribution of 64 nm amorphous silica nanoparticles (SNPs) in mice. The LD50 of SNPs was estimated as 262.4533.78 mg/kg, and the subsequent examination of dead animals revealed that SNPs probably induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) related to death.

      "The article discusses the use of liposomes to block the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and improve the tumor-specific accumulation of nanomaterials (NMs). The authors used positron emission tomography (PET) to monitor the in vivo tissue distribution of 64Cu-labeled 40 10 nm gold nanorods (Au NRs) after pretreatment with liposomes. They studied the effectiveness of liposome administration by comparing differently charged liposomes, different liposome doses, and varying time intervals between liposome dose and NR dose. By pre-injecting 400 mol/kg positively charged liposomes into mice 5 h before the Au NRs, the liver and spleen uptakes of Au NRs decreased by 30% and 53%, respectively. U87MG tumor uptake of Au NRs increased from 11.5 1.1 %ID/g to 16.1 1.3 %ID/g at 27 h post-injection.The article discusses the use of nanomaterials (NMs) in cancer theranostics. NMs can passively target solid tumor tissue due to the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. However, many NMs can be sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and cleared rapidly from the circulation before they reach the tumor. The article suggests that cationic liposomal pretreatment is a viable approach to reduce RES clearance, prolong circulation, and improve tumor uptake. The article also mentions attempts to minimize the sequestration of NMs by RES macrophages, including optimizing the physicochemical properties of NMs and preemptively suppressing RES macrophage activity. The article highlights the importance of understanding the biodistribution of NMs in vivo.The article discusses the use of liposomes to reduce the clearance of inorganic nanoparticles (NMs) by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in mice. Pre-administration of empty liposomes was found to decrease liver uptake of subsequent doses of similar vesicles, resulting in a near 2-fold enhancement of MRI signal in the tumor area. The study aimed to investigate the effect of this approach on the tissue distribution of a subsequent dose of gold nanorods (Au NRs), which are widely used in the theranostic field. The study utilized a direct 64Cu labeling method and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to track the distribution of Au NRs. The results of the study could guide future design and optimization of dosing strategies for maximal tumor enrichment of NMs.The article investigates the effect of liposome administration on the biodistribution of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in mice. The study varied the liposome charge, dose, and time interval between liposome and Au NR doses. After optimizing the procedure for pre-injection of liposomes, the liver and spleen uptake of the second Au NR dose decreased by 30% and 53%, respectively, while the tumor uptake increased by 50%. The liposomes were prepared using 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane. The hydrodynamic size of liposomes was measured by a Zetasizer Nano series, and ICP-AES was used to measure the concentration of Au NRs. PET scans were performed using an Inveon PET scanner.The article describes the preparation of 64Cu-labeled liposomes and gold nanorods (Au NRs) for in vivo imaging studies. The liposomes were prepared by encapsulating DOTA as a metal chelator and extruding through a polycarbonate filter of 200 nm pore size. The labeling efficiency was nearly 80%. The Au NRs were modified with SH-PEG-NH2 and labeled with 64CuCl2. The labeling efficiency was nearly 100%. The in vivo imaging studies were performed on athymic nude mice subcutaneously implanted with U87MG human glioblastoma cells. The cell viability of different liposomes on RAW cells was estimated by the standard MTT assay using the untreated group as a control.In this study, liposomes were incubated with cells and the cellular uptake of Au NRs was analyzed. The MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis were performed to measure the uptake of liposomes by cells. PET scans were obtained to study the biodistribution of liposomes and Au NRs in tumor-bearing mice. Ex vivo histological staining was performed to observe the tissues. The results showed that liposomes enhanced the cellular uptake of Au NRs. The biodistribution of liposomes and Au NRs was found to be different in various tissues. The study suggests that liposomes can be used as a carrier for Au NRs to improve their cellular uptake and biodistribution. The statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data.The article discusses the effect of surface charges of liposomes on RES blocking efficiency. Liposomes of around 200 nm were prepared with different surface charges using a thin film hydration method. The liposomes were uncharged, negative, or positive. The liposomes were found to be biocompatible and did not affect the cell cycle. The study investigated the influence of liposomes on the cellular uptake of Au NRs. The liposomes were found to saturate the receptors on macrophages for foreign particle recognition and deplete the opsonins from plasma, which is important for macrophages to recognize and engulf foreign particles. The study concludes that liposomes can be used to block the RES uptake of nanomaterials.The study aimed to investigate the extent to which liposome blockade can decrease cellular uptake of nanomaterials (NMs). The researchers compared the blockade effect of liposomes with different charges at the same dose and time interval. They treated RAW 264.7 cells with liposomes followed by Au NRs and quantified the cellular uptake of Au NRs after 24 hours. All three kinds of liposomes demonstrated blockade effects, while the positive liposomes were the most efficient ones. The researchers further studied the blockade effect at different time intervals and with various liposome doses. The results showed that the blockade effect is time and liposome concentration dependent. The in vivo biodistribution of different liposomes was also studied using 64Cu-based PET imaging.The article discusses the use of PET imaging to study the biodistribution of nanomaterials (NMs) in mice. The researchers used a method called remote loading to label liposomes with the isotope 64Cu, which allowed for high in vivo radiochemical stability. The liposomes were injected into mice and PET scanning showed that they accumulated mostly in the liver and spleen, with the spleen having the highest uptake for all three samples at 8 hours post-injection. The positive liposomes showed much higher liver accumulation than the neutral and negative liposomes. The study demonstrates that PET imaging is a useful tool for studying the biodistribution of NMs and that the surface charge of liposomes can affect their targeting ability.The article discusses the use of liposomes to block the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and improve the biodistribution of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in mice. Unlabeled liposomes were injected into tumor-bearing mice, followed by injection of 64Cu-labeled Au NRs. The positive liposomes showed the best blockade effect, decreasing liver and spleen uptake of Au NRs and increasing tumor uptake. The effect was transient and only effective during the first few hours. The in vivo effect of macrophage blockade was not as remarkable as that of the cellular level. The study highlights the importance of direct in vivo monitoring of nanomaterials to guide the rational design of theranostic nanomaterials.The article explores the effect of liposome dosage and time interval between liposome dose and the second NR dose to optimize the blockade efficiency. The experiment was conducted on mice, and liposome pretreatment successfully prevented RES clearance of the second dose of NRs. The heart signal was nearly twice that of the unblocked group, indicating enhanced blood circulation. Liposomes blocked the RES activity in all the groups with a similar trend. For groups with different liposome doses, there was no significant difference in the liver and spleen uptakes of Au NRs. The enhanced blood half-life benefited tumor accumulation.The article discusses the biodistribution of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in mice. The uptake of Au NRs in the liver and spleen was similar across different groups. Tumor uptake was slightly higher with a 5-hour pretreatment interval compared to a 1-hour interval. The reliability of PET imaging was confirmed by ICP-AES measurement. The in vivo results did not completely follow the same trend as the cellular level results, possibly due to competing processes such as disassembly of liposomes and dynamic evolution of biological identity. The liposome dosage did not have a significant effect on tumor uptake.The article discusses the use of liposomes to reduce the nonspecific uptake of nanomaterials (NMs) by the liver and spleen. The liposome-based RES blockade strategy has three advantages: it is a general approach to improve the circulation of NMs without altering their physicochemical properties, the effect is temporary and reversible with little damage to healthy organs, and it is easy to handle and potentially cost and time-saving. The authors conducted experiments on mice and found that liposomes at a concentration of 100 mol/kg were sufficient for achieving RES blockade without apparent toxicity or damage to major organs. The effect of pretreatment with liposomes on tissue distribution of a second dose of similar liposomes has been quantitatively evaluated.The article discusses the effectiveness of liposomes in blocking the reticuloendothelial system (RES) clearance of a second dose of gold nanorods (Au NRs). The study utilized PET imaging to monitor the in vivo behavior of liposomes and Au NRs labeled with 64Cu. The positive liposomes were found to have the best liver and spleen blockade efficiency among three differently charged liposomes. An injected dose of 100 mol/kg positive liposomes was sufficient for RES blocking, with the liver and spleen uptake of Au NRs decreased by 25% and 52%, respectively. The study also found that the tumor uptake of Au NRs has a relationship with the administered liposome dosage and the time interval between injections. The article highlights the importance of exploring the liposome blockade effect on specific nanomaterials before performing the strategy.The article discusses the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles (Au NMs) in mice following injection of liposomes. The study found that tumor uptake of Au NMs was 20% higher when injected with 400 mol/kg liposomes 5 hours ahead compared to 100 mol/kg liposomes 1 hour ahead. The study also suggests that suppressing RES macrophage activity and enhancing blood circulation of NMs may not be the only way to improve tumor uptake. The article emphasizes the need for detailed studies to identify the in vivo effectiveness of strategies influencing NM delivery, and PET imaging as a tool to monitor the biological fate of NMs. The study was supported by various funding sources and the authors declare no competing financial interest.The article discusses the challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials in cancer therapy.

Finally, the article includes TEM imaging and detailed information on the liposomes used in the study.The article describes an experiment to investigate the biodistribution of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in mice. The experiment involved pretreatment with different liposomes at varying concentrations and time intervals. The researchers used remote labeling of liposomes with 64Cu and measured the percentage of injected dose of 64Cu-labeled liposomes in the spleen and liver over time. They also conducted quantitative region-of-interest analysis of tumor, liver, spleen, and heart uptake of 64Cu-Au NRs over time with or without pretreatment of liposomes. The tissue distribution of 64Cu-labeled Au NRs was measured at different time intervals and concentrations. The results showed that pretreatment with positive liposomes increased the blood circulation half-life of a second dose of 64Cu-labeled Au NRs.The biodistribution of nanomaterials was studied in mice. The mice were given different doses of the nanomaterials and liposome pretreatment. The concentration of the nanomaterials was measured in various organs at different time points.

      "The article discusses the use of radiolabeled PEGylated liposomes with varying amounts of cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptide for targeting cancer sites. RGD peptides bind to v3 integrin receptors overexpressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis. The liposomal nanoparticles were synthesized using a combination of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-derivatized lipids. The study aimed to evaluate the influence of PEGylation and RGD loading on the targeting properties of the liposomes.The study describes the use of radiolabeled liposomes (RLPs) for targeting angiogenesis. The RLPs were labeled with indium-111 and contained a polyethylene glycol (PEG) building block and a lipid-based RGD building block. In vitro binding studies showed good binding to isolated v3 integrin receptors, which was dependent on the extent of RGD and PEG loading. Biodistribution studies in nude mice showed increased circulating time for PEGylated RLPs, but no dependence on RGD loading. The study concludes that the balance between PEGylation and RGD loading requires optimization to achieve targeting in vivo.Liposomal nanoparticles (LNPs) are useful carriers for various drugs, but their recognition by phagocytic cells leads to their rapid removal from the blood circulation into mainly the liver and spleen. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) improves the pharmacokinetics of LNPs by imparting a steric barrier to the surface of the liposome, thus minimizing opsonization. PEGylation has also been found to increase biological stability, reduce leakage of the encapsulated drug, and prevent aggregation. LNPs benefit from the enhanced permeability and retention effect where the long circulation time of nanoparticles allows accumulation in tissues with compromised vasculature, eg, areas of inflammation or tumors.Nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors through gaps between endothelial cells and the absence of lymphatic vessels. However, this passive targeting lacks cell-specific interaction, reducing therapeutic efficacy. The challenge is to combine passive with active targeting using target-specific sequences. In this study, a cyclic RGD peptide was used as a target-specific sequence to bind to v3 integrin receptors expressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis. These receptors are weakly expressed in nondiseased tissue, making it a specific target for antiangiogenic therapy monitoring and tumor angiogenesis imaging.Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be labeled with various radionuclides for noninvasive imaging using nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as SPECT or PET. LNPs have been labeled with radionuclides for use in radionuclide therapy in cancer patients. Radiolabeling of LNPs using a DTPA-derivatized lipid building block has been investigated. The influence of surface modifications on the pharmacokinetics of LNPs was investigated. LNPs derivatized with an RGD peptide were used for micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies to explore their future usage in cancer diagnosis and therapy as well as for multimodal imaging.The article describes the preparation of SAMA-RGD using solid phase peptide synthesis technique with a commercial batch synthesizer. The synthesized product was purified by HPLC and freeze-dried, followed by carbon-nitrogen cyclization of the linear protected peptide in acetonitrile. The radioactivity of the samples was measured using a 2480 Wizard2 Automatic Gamma Counter. The human v3 integrin receptor was purchased from EMD Millipore. Human melanoma cells (M21 and M21-L) and human glioblastoma astrocytoma cells (U-87 MG) were used in the experiment.The article describes the preparation of RLPs (sterically stabilized liposomes) using a ternary lipid mixture. The RLPs were crosslinked with SAMA-RGD and DSPE-PEG(2000)-Mal using in situ deprotection of the S-acetyl group with hydroxylamine. The crosslinking was monitored by reversed-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. The article also mentions the use of benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate and 2% hydrazine hydrate in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone for cleavage and cyclization steps.Lipid mixtures with varying amounts of RGD and DSPE-PEG(2000) were prepared and extruded to form liposomes.

The maximum storage time for liposomal suspensions was 1 month.The article describes the methods used to measure the zeta potential of various liposomes using a Nicomp 380 ZLS Particle Sizer. Radiolabeling was performed using 111In chloride and the radiolabeling efficiency was determined using instant thin layer chromatography. The in vitro binding affinities of various RLPs were determined using isolated human v3 integrin receptors. Two different approaches were used for this purpose: competition assay and receptor saturation assay.The binding affinities of RLPs were determined using 125I-cyclo-(-RGDyV-) as the radioligand. The receptors were coated with isolated v3 integrin receptors and incubated with blocking buffer. RLPs were labeled with 111In chloride and incubated with the receptors for 2 hours. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values were calculated by fitting the data with nonlinear regression.The article describes an experiment to evaluate the biodistribution of radiolabeled nanoparticles in vivo. The experiment was conducted on v3 integrin receptor expressing M21 cells and U-87 MG cells. Biodistribution studies were performed on female athymic BALB/c nude mice with tumor xenografts induced by injecting M21 cells subcutaneously. The experiment was conducted in compliance with Austrian animal protection laws and with the approval of the Austrian Ministry of Science.Female mice with tumors were injected with different types of 111In-RLPs (lowRLP, medRLP, highRLP, medRLP with no PEG) and sacrificed at 1 or 4 hours post-injection to measure radioactivity in organs, tissues, and tumors. Imaging studies were also carried out on mice injected with 111In-lowRLP, 111In-medRLP, and 111In-highRLP at 4, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-injection using a NanoSPECT/CT in vivo preclinical imager.The article describes the characterization and radiolabeling of RLPs, which are liposomes of different sizes. The RLPs were labeled with 111In chloride and tested in vitro for receptor binding studies. The biodistribution of the RLPs was also studied in tumor-xenografted BALB/c nude mice using an unpaired t-test with a significance level of P 0.01. The particle size distribution was highly homogenous for all tested RLPs, and the mean diameter of the liposomes was 92.1 3.1 nm for lowRLP, 99.2 2.4 nm for medRLP, and 110.4 4.3 nm for highRLP.The article evaluates the effect of RGD loading and PEGylation on the binding of radiolabeled liposomes (RLPs) to v3 integrin receptors. The study found that higher RGD loading increased binding to the receptors, while PEGylation had a detrimental effect on binding. Biodistribution studies in mice showed that the major uptake of RLPs was in the spleen and liver, with PEGylated RLPs displaying high blood levels.The biodistribution of three different types of radiolabeled RLPs was studied in mice. At 1 hour post-injection, accumulation was low in most organs except for the lungs. Blood levels were low for 111In-medRLP with no added PEGylation, but uptake in the spleen and liver was high. At 4 hours post-injection, uptake in the liver and spleen had increased. Micro-SPECT/CT imaging showed similar biodistribution patterns for all RLPs, with high uptake in the liver, spleen, and intestine. The receptor-positive tumor was not clearly visualized.The study investigated the in vitro and in vivo properties of LNPs carrying RGD and PEG building blocks and their ability to target v3 integrin receptors overexpressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis. Several 111In-labeled RLPs derivatized with varying amounts of RGD and PEG building blocks were prepared to investigate their performance in vitro and in vivo using biodistribution experiments and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies. In vitro binding to isolated v3 integrin receptors revealed the highest binding when no PEG building block was used, and binding decreased with higher PEG loading of the RLPs. However, PEGylation is advantageous when using LNPs in vivo as it prolongs their circulation time and reduces recognition by the mononuclear phagocyte system.The article discusses the biodistribution of RLPs, which are designed to be used as carriers for drugs. The RLPs are modified with PEG chains and RGD-targeting sequences. The amount of PEG connected to the RGD building block affects the stealth effect of the liposome. The RLPs were evaluated with respect to their RGD loading, and higher RGD loading led to significantly higher binding to the v3 integrin receptors. The specific uptake in hepatic stellate cells increased with higher RGD loading of the sterically stabilized liposomes.The biodistribution of RGD-modified liposomes (RLPs) was studied using 111In-labeled RLPs. The highest uptake of RLPs was observed in the liver and spleen, with suboptimal tumor targeting characteristics. The tumor uptake values were slightly higher than those of the negative control, but the differences were not significant. The reduced tumor targeting of RLPs might be related to the PEG(2000) chain length and the v3 integrin receptors of the solid tumors used in the current xenograft model. The authors suggested that shorter PEG chains may be advantageous for binding sites on the tumor.The article discusses the challenges of targeting tumors with liposomal nanoparticles (RLPs) and the importance of determining the optimal concentration of targeting sequences, PEG loading, and particle formation. The study found that specific targeting of RLPs to tumors could not be visualized using micro-SPECT/CT imaging, but a similar accumulation pattern was seen compared to ex vivo biodistribution studies. The article also mentions the potential negative effects of high concentrations of targeting moieties and the importance of choosing the optimal injected lipid dose. Overall, the experimental results did not show any evidence of specific tumor targeting of RLPs in vivo.The stability of LNPs after intravenous injection is crucial for targeting. Radiolabeling studies have shown high in vitro stability of LNPs in competition with aqueous solution, human serum, and DTPA, as well as high blood pool retention in vivo. The size and charge of the LNP also influence targeting properties and in vivo stability. Liposomes carrying RGD peptides have been shown to have antitumor activity and have been used for selective cell targeting to treat cardiovascular disease. Future experiments will investigate the ideal balance of RGD and PEG loading.The study investigated the influence of PEGylation and RGD loading of different LNPs in relation to their targeting properties, particularly to visualize tumor-induced angiogenesis. The biodistribution and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies showed that an optimized balance between PEGylation and RGD loading needs to be found to achieve ideal specific tumor targeting in vivo. The study concludes that LNPs are an attractive tool for targeting strategies, and an ideal multimodal nanoparticle featured with different types of ligands used for diagnosis, imaging, and therapy is much needed in the future.

The liver and spleen retained high activity, and the majority of 68GaDOTABNTMCMNPs cleared from blood circulation during the first 30 minutes via Kupffer cells phagocytic sequestration in the liver. The activity of small intestine started to increase following the reduction in liver activity, which represents the elimination pathway of NPs.

      "The article describes a new method for radiolabeling polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer micelles using tropolone as a lipophilic ligand to entrap the radiolabel (111In) in the micellar core during the formation of the micelles. This method does not require any chemical modification and is a fast and facile way to radiolabel the micelles. The radiolabeled micelles can be used for in vivo evaluation of their biodistribution using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The article highlights that most radiolabeling procedures published to date involve the conjugation of a chelating agent to the polymer, which could affect their biodistribution.The article describes the development of a robust and reproducible radiolabeling method for polymeric micelles, which are promising nanocarriers for pharmaceutical formulations. The radiolabeled micelles were evaluated in vivo and ex vivo in non-tumor-bearing mice, revealing significant blood circulation up to at least 24 hours post-injection, with low accumulation in most organs except for the liver and spleen, which are the natural organs for clearance of nanoparticles. The radiolabeling method is shown to be applicable for future investigation of polymeric micelles as nanocarriers in tumor-bearing mice. The study was funded by the Seventh Framework Programme.Diblock copolymer micellar aggregates can be designed with well-defined dimensions and morphologies by varying the composition, size, and structure of the block copolymers. Polymeric micelles have favorable characteristics that have led to clinical applications for systemic chemotherapy. Nanocarriers can accumulate in diseased tissue due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which can be accomplished by exploiting either active or passive targeting pathways. Long blood circulation time is an important factor to improve accumulation in tumor tissue. Even though the scientific community is gaining considerable knowledge about the various factors that can affect the biodistribution of nanoparticles, it is still difficult to predict the in vivo behavior of nanoparticles.The article discusses the importance of pre-clinical evaluation of nanomaterial formulations and the use of nuclear imaging techniques such as SPECT and PET for this purpose. Radiolabeling of polymeric micelles is required for imaging, but current methods involve the conjugation of micelles with a chelate or complexing agent, which could alter their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. The article presents a new radiolabeling method based on passive loading that is applied to micelles composed of the diblock copolymer polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO). The method involves entrapping a lipophilic ligand complexed with the radionuclide in the micellar core, leaving the PEO corona unaffected. The article describes the radiolabeling strategy and demonstrates its ease and efficiency, as well as an initial in vivo evaluation of these micelles in healthy mice using SPECT.The article describes the production and radiolabeling of micelles using a PS-b-PEO block copolymer and 111In-tropolone complexes. The micelles were characterized physically using dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies. The block copolymer had a Mw/Mn ratio of 1.09 and the 111InCl3 had a specific activity of 1.72MBq/pmol. Sephadex G-25 and Sepharose 4B size exclusion chromatography resins, HEPES, PIPES, and tropolone were used in the experiment. Unencapsulated 111In-tropolone was removed from the radiolabeled micelles by means of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Sephadex G-25 column. The labeling efficiency was determined as the amount of 111In encapsulated in the micelles relative to the total amount of 111In added to the sample.The article describes a study on the biodistribution of nanomaterials. The size and shape of the nanomaterials were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The partition study involved mixing PIPES or HEPES buffer with tropolone and 111In, and then separating the aqueous and organic phases. The distribution ratio (D) of 111In was calculated.The biodistribution of nanomaterials was studied by assessing the concentration of 111In in chloroform and HEPES buffer at different pH levels. The radiolabeling parameters were optimized by varying the polymer concentration, 111In activity, tropolone concentration, and pH. The micelles were prepared by adding a PS-b-PEO block copolymer solution in chloroform to HEPES buffer containing 0.8mM tropolone, and then adding 111In-tropolone chloroform solution in portions of 2L until an activity of 50kBq was reached. The unencapsulated 111In-tropolone was removed from the radiolabeled micelles.The article describes the biodistribution of PS-b-PEO micelles in Balb/c-nu mice. The micelles were radiolabeled with 111In and their retention was assessed in PBS and mouse serum. The micelles were separated from the released 111In using SEC columns. In vivo tests were conducted by injecting 22MBq of 111In-labeled micelles into three mice and subjecting them to SPECT/CT scans. One mouse was subjected to a dynamic scan during the first 60 minutes post-injection. The study found that the micelles had a high accumulation in the liver and spleen, and low accumulation in the heart and lungs.The biodistribution of micelles was studied in mice using SPECT/CT imaging and ex vivo autoradiography. The mice were euthanized after the last SPECT/CT acquisition, and blood and organs were collected for analysis. The uptake of the micelles in different tissues was calculated using a gamma counter, and ex vivo autoradiography was performed on selected organs. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Dutch animal welfare regulations. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and GraphPad Prism software. The physical characterization of the micelles was also reported.The article discusses the morphology and stability of PS-b-PEO micelles, which have a spherical shape with a PS core diameter ranging from 25 to 40nm and a small number of rod-like micelles. The micelles have good stability upon dilution, with an overall average hydrodynamic radius of 9713nm. Radiolabeling parameters were optimized, and the distribution ratio of 111In in a mixture of chloroform and HEPES buffer containing tropolone was determined to be 4.80.5, indicating that indium has a preference for the organic phase.The article discusses the biodistribution of nanomaterials and the radiolabeling efficiency of PS-b-PEO block copolymers. The study found that the D values were comparable for pH 4.5 to 7.4 and lower for pH 8.5. The radiolabeling efficiency increased with the polymer up to 1.1mg/mL and then plateaued at about 30%. The optimal tropolone concentration was found to be between 0.1 and 10mM. The radiolabeling efficiency remained constant up to pH 7.4 and slightly decreased at higher pH values. The study also tested active loading as an alternative to passive loading and found it to be successful.The article discusses the biodistribution of 111In-PS-b-PEO micelles in mice. The micelles were stable in saline and mouse serum, with a fast release rate in the first 24 hours followed by negligible loss in the next 24 hours. Dynamic SPECT/CT images showed that the micelles were primarily in circulation up to 4 hours post-injection, and then accumulated in the spleen and liver at 24 hours post-injection. Whole-body retention of activity at 24 hours post-injection was estimated to be more than 85%. Ex vivo biodistribution analysis showed the percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue. The active loading method had a retention rate of 223%, while passive loading had a retention rate of up to 322%.The article discusses the biodistribution of PS-b-PEO micelles in mice using SPECT/CT imaging and ex vivo autoradiography. The micelles showed elevated uptake in the spleen and liver, with non-homogeneous staining in the spleen. Blood samples revealed that the micelles were still in circulation at 24 hours post-injection. The study aimed to develop a simple and fast radiolabeling method for PS-b-PEO micelles that does not alter their properties. The authors suggest that their method could be used to evaluate the behavior of other nanomaterials in vivo.The article discusses the use of polymeric micelles as carriers for therapeutic agents. The micelles are composed of a block copolymer and are synthesized through self-assembly in chloroform-in-water emulsion droplets. The micelles are used to encapsulate radionuclides in the micellar core, providing a novel and facile radiolabeling method that does not require chemical modifications. The physical characteristics of the block copolymer, PS-b-PEO, are used to entrap lipophilic entities, such as tropolone, which is used as a ligand in radiolabeling. The biodistribution and loss of radiolabel in the micelles are affected by the location of the radiolabeling and the introduction of a chelating agent.The article discusses a method for radiolabeling micelles using a passive process. Tropolone is complexed with indium (111In) and their distribution ratio is determined to be above 1, showing a tendency to accumulate in the chloroform phase. The radiolabeling efficiency is limited by the distribution ratio and the amount of chloroform present in the micellar core during micellization. The radiolabeling procedure is highly reproducible and has only a slight dependence on different radiolabeling parameters such as polymer, tropolone, and indium concentration, and pH. The radiolabeling efficiency remains nearly the same for tropolone concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10mM. The radiolabeling efficiency remains the same between pH 4.5 and 7.4 and only at pH 8.5 a small decline is observed.The article discusses a radiolabeling procedure using PEO-b-PS block polymers and tropolone as a lipophilic ligand to encapsulate indium-111 (111In) for biodistribution studies. The labeling efficiency and distribution ratio of the radiolabeled micelles were found to decrease at alkaline pH due to the formation of InOH4, which cannot complex with tropolone. However, the anticipated reduction in labeling efficiency at lower pH was not observed, possibly due to the structure of tropolone. The retention of radiolabel in serum was limited but acceptable. The procedure may be applicable to other block polymers and radionuclides capable of complexing with tropolone or similar lipophilic ligands.The article discusses the biodistribution of PS-b-PEO micelles, which are carriers for systemic application. The micelles' ability to accumulate in diseased tissue while avoiding clearance mechanisms is crucial for high tumor uptake. The micelles are typically cleared by macrophages in the liver and spleen, resulting in substantial retention in these organs. The spleen uptake is higher than other block copolymer micelles due to the rigidity of the PS-b-PEO particles, making them more prone to spleen filtration. The investigated organs show a low uptake profile, with little standard deviation, except for the surprisingly elevated stomach uptake.The article describes a new method to produce and radiolabel spherical PS-b-PEO block copolymer micelles. The radiolabeling efficiency is sufficient to achieve micelle activities of up to several hundred megabecquerel. The biodistribution of the micelles was studied in mice, and the results showed blood circulation even 24 hours post-injection, with high accumulation in the spleen and liver. The authors expect that these micelles will have long enough circulation time to ensure high tumor uptake, which should be further tested in tumor-bearing mice.

The article is licensed by Dove Medical Press Limited and is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial License.The article describes the preparation of a self-assembled pH-sensitive curcumin-loaded nanoparticle for breast cancer theranostics. The nanoparticle was prepared using hyaluronan-cholesteryl hemisuccinate conjugates (HA-CHEMS) and D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). The physicochemical properties of the nanoparticle were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic lighter scattering (DLS). The in vitro cytotoxicity of the nanoparticle was evaluated using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay.

The article concludes that the nanoparticle greatly inhibited tumor growth without resulting in obvious toxicities to major organs.The article discusses the potential of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs for breast cancer theranostics. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol molecule, has antineoplastic properties but its clinical application is limited due to low solubility and rapid metabolism. Nanocarriers have been developed for drug delivery to increase solubility, prolong duration in vivo, improve tumor-selective cytotoxicity, and reduce drug exposure to normal tissues. Polymeric nanocarriers, including HA-derivatives, have exhibited good biocompatibility and can target CD44-overexpressed solid cancer and cancer stem cells. The article highlights the potential of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs with stable 99mTc labeling and high curcumin-loading capacity for breast cancer synergistic theranostics.The article discusses the use of HA-based nanoparticles for tumor-targeted delivery of bortezomib to myeloma in vivo. The nanoparticles showed enhanced tolerance and more effective growth suppression of CD44-overexpressed tumors. The article also discusses the use of TPGS as an anticancer drug enhancer and its ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance in multiple tumor cells. The article suggests that nuclear imaging, particularly SPECT, provides non-invasive detection with high sensitivity and quantification suitable for diagnosis. Technetium-99m (99mTc) is a readily available and inexpensive radionuclide that can be used to label nanoparticles for tumor-targeting imaging. The article proposes that 99mTc radiolabeled nanoparticles could facilitate non-invasive quantitative diagnosis and allow for personalized treatments by utilizing the same nanoparticles.The article describes the synthesis of nanoparticles using amphiphilic HA-cholesteryl hemisuccinate conjugates loaded with docetaxel and curcumin for targeted delivery to CD44-overexpressed tumors. The nanoparticles were stable and had high drug loading. The higher molecular weight HA provided greater charge shielding and higher affinity with CD44 receptors. The nanocarrier was radiolabeled with 99mTc for SPECT imaging and quantification of tumor targeting ability. The nanoparticles were tested on 4T1 mice mammary cancer cells and showed efficient antitumor effects. The study was carried out in compliance with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.The article describes the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles loaded with curcumin using HA-cholesteryl hemisuccinate (HA-CHEMS) and TPGS.

The morphology of the nanoparticles was visualized using transmission electron microscopy. The entrapment efficiency and drug loading were also measured. The yield of HA-CHEMS synthesis was 90.3%. The article does not provide information on the biodistribution of the nanoparticles.The study investigated the release behavior of curcumin from HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs by dialyzing the NPs against PBS at different pH levels. The radiolabeling efficiency and stability of the NPs were examined using 99mTc. In vitro cytotoxicity of different HA nanoparticles was tested on 4T1 mice mammary cancer cells. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution were conducted on tumor-bearing mice. The study found that the HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs had high cytotoxicity against 4T1 cells and showed good tumor-targeting ability in vivo.The study aimed to investigate the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, antitumor efficacy, and toxicity of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in mice. The tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with the NPs, and the radioactivity of major organs was measured. Blood samples were collected to study in vivo plasma pharmacokinetics. The antitumor efficacy was evaluated by using the mouse flank tumor model bearing murine breast 4T1 cells. The nanoparticles were given every 2 days for a total of 5 times. The tumor volume and body weight were measured every 2 days. The survival of mice was also recorded. Statistical analysis was carried out to evaluate the significance between groups.The article describes the preparation and characterization of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were prepared using the solvent-exchange method and the drug loading was optimized by investigating the influence of TPGS content on particle size and drug loading. The hydrodynamic diameter of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS nanoparticles was found to be 144 nm, which was similar to the size of HA-CHEMS nanoparticles. The nanoparticles had a spherical structure with an average size of 98 nm. The biodistribution of the nanoparticles was not discussed in this excerpt.The article describes the characterization of nanoparticles (NPs) made of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS, which were synthesized for drug delivery purposes. The NPs were characterized for size, morphology, colloidal stability, drug loading, and release behavior. The NPs exhibited good colloidal stability and sustained release behavior. The entrapment efficiency and drug loading of the NPs were determined using HPLC. The fast release of curcumin at low pH is likely due to the pH sensitivity of cholesteryl hemisuccinate in HA-CHEMS. The article also discusses the biodistribution of the NPs in vivo, showing that they accumulated in the liver and spleen.The article discusses the use of radiolabeling to track the biodistribution of nanoparticles (NPs) containing a drug called Curcumin (Cur) for cancer treatment. The NPs are made up of hyaluronic acid (HA), CHEMS, Cur, and TPGS. The CHEMS undergoes a phase transformation in a lower pH environment, leading to rapid drug release. The NPs were radiolabeled with 99mTc, which binds to the carboxyl group of HA and forms a stable compound. The radiolabeling efficiency was up to 80.81.7%, and the radiolabeled NPs were found to be suitable for clinical application. The article suggests that maintaining the drug within the NPs for a long time in the blood is necessary for effective drug accumulation in tumors.The article investigates the stability and cytotoxicity of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS nanoparticles. The stability of the radiolabeled nanoparticles was tested in vitro and found to be stable for further in vivo study. The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated in 4T1 cells using the MTT assay. HA-CHEMS NPs showed no toxicity up to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The IC50 values of curcumin, HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs, HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs, and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs were 77, 58, 103, and 38 g/mL, respectively. HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs showed the highest toxicity for 4T1 cells, indicating enhanced antitumor efficiency. The combination index (CI) value of HA-CHEMS-Cur and TPGS was calculated as 0.79, indicating moderate synergism.The study aimed to evaluate the tumor-targeting ability of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in 4T1-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. MicroSPECT imaging of radiolabeled 99mTc was employed to record the in vivo biodistribution. The radioactive intensity at the tumor sites was obviously higher in the 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs group than in the control. The tumor uptake of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs peaked at 4 h post-injection, indicating that HA can actively target to tumor tissue. The nanoparticles can accumulate in a tumor via the enhanced permeation retention (EPR) effect or nanomaterials-induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL). Moreover, a high concentration with prolonged retention of the nanoparticles can provide more drug release to tumor cells and potentially induce more cell death.The study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in mice. The blood circulation time of the NPs was found to be prolonged (t1/2 = 7.8 h) compared to free curcumin (t1/2 = 8 min). The biodistribution analysis showed that the NPs accumulated more in the liver and spleen compared to other organs. The total activity of the NPs decreased fast, indicating quick excretion in normal organs and decreased cytotoxicity to healthy tissue. The study also assessed the in vivo antitumor efficacy and systemic toxicity of the NPs.The study evaluated the toxicity and biodistribution of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs in 4T1-tumor-bearing mice. The mice were administered with HA-CHEMS NPs (control), HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs, and two curcumin formulations at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The HA-CHEMS-TPGS NPs showed a relatively higher effect of tumor reduction, while HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs exhibited the highest tumor growth inhibition. The biodistribution study demonstrated that the retention of HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was only 0.880.18 ID%/g in the tumor after 24 h. The study concluded that TPGS can enhance the curcumin antitumor efficacy in vivo, and HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs have better antitumor efficiency than HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs. The treated groups of mice displayed no severe weight loss, indicating that nanoparticles have little systematic toxicity.The study prepared 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs for chemotherapy and conducted nuclear imaging for breast cancer in mice. The NPs exhibited a uniform particle size distribution, excellent in vitro stability, and high radiolabeling efficiency with good radiostability. The in vivo SPECT imaging demonstrated that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs could actively target breast cancer in mice. The retention of 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs was higher than 3%ID/g until 8 h post-injection, with fast total body excretion. The antitumor inhibition results confirmed that the antitumor efficiency of curcumin was elevated with the help of TPGS without obvious toxicity compared with HA-CHEMS-Cur NPs. The findings indicated that 99mTc-HA-CHEMS-Cur-TPGS NPs are an excellent antitumor nanomedicine for breast cancer with enhanced tumor-specific accumulation, improved antitumor efficiency, and low side effects.The article discusses the potential of nanomaterials with CD44 active targeting for breast cancer theranostics.

The NPs were spherical and uniform in size with a diameter of about 130 nm and negative zeta potential. The optimal amount of stannous chloride required for higher labeling efficiency with lower free 99mTc and R/H of 99mTc was found to be 20 g. The optimal pH value and incubation time of the NPs, which can obtain high labeling efficiency, was 7.0 and 15 min, respectively. Quality control tests were performed by TLC using ITLC strips.The study aimed to assess the stability of 99mTc-labeled nanoparticles (NPs) in vitro after incubation with human serum and NaCl solutions. The labeling efficiency of three types of NPs was tested, and the results showed that they were stable in serum and normal saline within 24 hours.

The NPs were found to be mainly concentrated in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with high radioactivity in the liver, spleen, and kidney. The low level of radioactivity detected in the stomach suggests that the release of 99mTc in vivo was negligible.

Static images were obtained with a 512x512 matrix and a pixel side length of 0.4 mm, resulting in a total imaging time of 757 seconds. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software, and all results are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) for the values obtained from a minimum of three independent experiments. The work was supported by funding from Wenzhou Science Technology Bureau and NSFC projects.
